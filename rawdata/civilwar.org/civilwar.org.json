William S. Rosecrans hoped to continue the offensive and force Maj. Gen. Braxton Bragg\u2019s Confederate Army of Tennessee out of Chattanooga.\u00a0 Rosecrans consolidated Union forces that had been scattered throughout Tennessee and Georgia, and forced Bragg to evacuate the city.\u00a0 Bragg concentrated his forces in LaFayette, Georgia, and determined to reoccupy the valuable Chattanooga.\u00a0 He followed the Union army north, skirmishing with them at Davis\u2019 Cross Roads.\u00a0 By September 17, Bragg had been reinforced with Virginia divisions under Gen. John Bell Hood and a Mississippi division under Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson\u2014the first attempt to transport Confederate troops from one theater to another to achieve numerical superiority.\u00a0 With renewed confidence that Chattanooga could pass once again into Confederate hands, on the morning of the 18th Bragg marched his army to the west bank of Chickamauga Creek, hoping to wedge his troops between Chattanooga and the Federal army.\u00a0 As Bragg\u2019s infantry crossed the creek on the 18th, they skirmished with Federal infantry and mounted infantry armed with Spencer repeating rifles.\u00a0 Bragg had been hoping that his advance would be a surprise; Rosecrans, however, had observed the Confederates marching in the morning, and anticipated Bragg\u2019s plan.\u00a0 By the time Bragg\u2019s army had crossed the creek, Union reinforcements had arrived.\n\nThe Battle of Chickamauga began in earnest shortly after dawn on September 19th.\u00a0 Throughout the day Bragg\u2019s men gained ground but could not break the extended Union line despite a series of aggressive attacks.\u00a0 Confederate luck changed when, at 11 p.m., Gen. Longstreet\u2019s divisions arrived at Chickamauga, giving the Confederate force superior numbers.\u00a0 Bragg divided his forces into two wings. Longstreet commanded the left; Lt. Gen. Leonidas K. Polk took charge of Confederate troops on the right. The battle resumed at 9:30 a.m. the next morning, with coordinated Confederate attacks on the Union left flank.\u00a0 About an hour later, Rosecrans, believing a gap existed in his line, ordered Brig. Gen. Thomas Wood\u2019s division to fill the gap.\u00a0 Wood, however, knew that the order was a mistake; no such gap existed in the Federal line, and moving his division would, in turn, open a large swath in the Union position.\u00a0 However, Wood had already been berated twice in the campaign for not promptly following orders.\u00a0 To avoid further reprimand, he immediately moved, creating a division wide hole in the Union line. This was the chance that the Confederates needed.\u00a0 Longstreet massed a striking force, led by Gen. Hood, of eight brigades divided into three lines.\u00a0 Longstreet\u2019s men hammered through the gap that Wood had created, and Union resistance at the southern end of the battlefield evaporated as Federal troops, including Rosecrans himself, were pushed off the field.\n\nGeorge H. Thomas, in a move that would earn him the name \u201cThe Rock of Chickamauga,\u201d took command and began consolidating the scattered Union forces on Horseshoe Ridge and Snodgrass Hill. Thomas and his men formed a defensive position, and although Confederates continued to assault and pressed to within feet of the Union line, the Yankees held firm.\u00a0 Thomas withdrew as darkness fell. Although Thomas urged Rosecrans to lead the army in an attack the next day, Rosecrans rejected the idea and remained in Chattanooga.\u00a0 Bragg\u2019s victorious army occupied the heights surrounding Chattanooga, blocking Federal supply lines, but did not pursue Rosecrans.\n\nWhile Chickamauga was a decided Confederate victory, the results of the battle were staggering.\u00a0 With over 16,000 Union and 18,000 Confederate casualties, Chickamauga reached the highest losses of any battle in the Western theater.\u00a0 Although the Confederates had driven Rosecrans from the field, they had not succeeded in Bragg\u2019s goals of destroying Rosecrans\u2019s army or reoccupying Chattanooga.

Burnside only lasted a single campaign at the head of the Army of the Potomac. His abject failure at Fredericksburg, followed by further fumbling on January's \"Mud March,\" convinced President Abraham Lincoln to make a change.\nMajor General Joseph Hooker's energetic make-over polished the Northern army into tip-top condition, and with more strength than ever before. The army commander outmaneuvered Lee in late April, when the weather finally allowed roads to harden enough for marching.\nSwinging far beyond Lee's left, Hooker closed up on the Chancellorsville intersection on the last evening in April. He never managed to escape the clutches of the Wilderness, though\u2014the tangled, brush-choked thickets that covered about 70 square miles around Chancellorsville.\nOn May 1, Lee hurriedly gathered his army from its far-flung camps across the Old Dominion. He used his regiments to hem the quiescent Hooker into the Wilderness, pushing west along the two primary corridors in the region\u2014the Orange Turnpike and the Orange Plank Road.\nThat evening Lee and his incomparable lieutenant, Stonewall Jackson, conceived their greatest, and last, collaboration. Early on May 2 Jackson took nearly 30,000 men off on a march that clandestinely crossed the front of the enemy army and swung around behind it. That left Lee with only about 15,000 men to hold off Hooker's army. He managed that formidable task by feigning attacks with a scant line of skirmishers.\nSoon after 5 p.m. Jackson, having completed his circuit around the enemy, unleashed his men in an overwhelming attack on Hooker's right flank and rear. They shattered the Federal Eleventh Corps and pushed the Northern army back more than two miles.\nWhen Jackson's men burst out of the thickets screaming the Rebel Yell that afternoon, they dashed across the high-water mark of the Army of Northern Virginia. About three hours later the army suffered a nadir as low as the afternoon's zenith, when Jackson fell mortally wounded by the mistaken fire of his own men.\nThe long marches, high risks, and veiled stratagems of May 1-2 gave way on the 3rd to a slugging match in the woods on three sides of Chancellorsville intersection. Hooker abandoned key ground in a further display of timidity; Confederate artillery roared from a crucial hilltop, employing a brand-new battalion organization; and Southern infantry doggedly pushed ahead.\nWhen a Confederate artillery round smashed into a pillar against which Hooker was leaning, the Federal leader spent an unconscious half hour. His return to semi-sentience disappointed the veteran corps commanders who had hoped, unencumbered by Hooker, to employ their army's considerable untapped might.\nBy mid-morning, Southern infantry smashed through the final resistance and united in the Chancellorsville clearing. Their boisterous, well-earned, celebration did not run long: word came from the direction of Fredericksburg that a Northern rearguard had broken through and threatened the rear.\nThe May 3 Battle of Salem Church, just west of Fredericksburg, halted the threat from the east. Lee went to that zone in person to ensure final success on the 4th, then returned to Chancellorsville to superintend the corralling of Hooker's defeated army.\nHooker re-crossed the Rappahannock River to its left bank, whence he had come, early on May 6. The campaign had cost him about 18,000 casualties, and his enemy about 13,000.

Gen. Oliver O. Howard informed Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood that his division had been chosen for the \"arduous and dangerous task...to find the extreme right of the enemy's position, turn it, and attack him in flank.\" Supporting the assault would be Brig. Gen. Richard Johnson's division of the Fourteenth Corps.\u00a0\nMarching east with his troops, Howard discovered that the Rebels' flank would be hard to turn, as they were extending their line and digging in. Joseph Johnston, aware of the Federals' intent, pulled Patrick Cleburne's division from William J. Hardee's sector and placed it on the extreme right of the Confederate line, near a farm and gristmill owned by the widow Martha \"Fanny\" Pickett, whose husband was killed at Chickamauga. A late morning reconnaissance reveled the Federal troops marching across his front. Cleburne knew to expect an attack.\u00a0\nAt 3:35pm, Howard jotted a note to Gen. William T. Sherman, stating he could not be sure that his troops had reached the enemy flank. An impatient Sherman ordered him to attack anyway. Wood told Howard, \"We will put in Hazen and see what success he has.\" Wood thus has arranged his troops with Brig. Gen. William B. Hazen's brigade in front; its charge would be supported by Col. William H. Gibson's and Col. Frederick Knefler's brigades.\u00a0\nHazen's assault began around 5:00pm. For a time, the Federals threatened to overlap the Confederate right, but Cleburne shuttled troops to extend his line, held by Brig. Gen. John Kelly's cavalry. Brig. Gen. Hiram Granbury's troops did not have time to entrench when the Yankees charged. \"Ah, damn you, we have caught you without your logs now,\" some Federals yelled. Yet, even without entrenchments, the Confederates bloodily repulsed Hazen's brigade before Gibson's and Knefler's joined the attack. Col. Benjamin Scribner's brigade of Johnson's division also advanced, driving Kelly's troopers back into the Southern infantry line, but was stopped there. By 7:00pm, Wood and Howard concluded that further assaults were pointless.\u00a0\nThe Confederates had won a comparatively easy defensive victory at Pickett's Mill. To Ambrose Bierce, an officer on Hazen's staff, the Union attack on May 27 was a \"crime\"; it had gained nothing. Union casulaties were 230 killed, 1,016 wounded and 319 missing, for a total of 1,580 (Hazen lost almost a third of them). Cleburne counted 85 dead and 383 wounded; most of these were in Granbury's brigade, fighting without \"logs.\" Probably 200 of Kelly's troopers also fell, making the total Southern loss 648 men.\u00a0\nHaving beaten the enemy attack on the 27th, that night Johnston planned one of his own on the next day. The afternoon's fighting had established the left of Sherman's position. Johnston planned a flank march and attack in the same sector. As at Resaca and Cassville, he called on Gen. John Bell Hood to direct it. hood's troops started marching before dawn on May 28. At daylight, Hood discovered that the Federals had pulled back to a safer position during the night and were entrenched too formidably to be attacked. He sent word of this back to Johnston who, disappointed, ordered Hood back to his place in line.\u00a0\nThis text appears as part of the Civil War Trust's Atlanta Campaign Battle App\u00ae.

Confederate General Braxton Bragg, looking to capitalize on his victory against Rosecrans, followed the Federals to Chattanooga and established positions on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain, successfully putting the Union troops under siege and cutting off their supply line. On October 17, General Ulysses S. Grant was given control over the newly-created Military Division of the Mississippi, , effectively putting\u00a0 all Federal troops in the Western Theatre\u2014including the Army of the Cumberland\u2014under Grant\u2019s control.\u00a0 In the days that followed, Grant learned that Rosecrans was planning to withdraw the Army of the Cumberland from Chattanooga, thereby surrendering the strategically important city. Grant immediately replaced Rosecrans with General George H. Thomas and ordered Thomas to hold Chattanooga, to which he responded \u201cwe will hold the town till we starve.\u201d In an effort to send support to the beleaguered men of the Army of Cumberland, Grant set up \u201cThe Cracker Line\u201d to move food to the soldiers at Chattanooga.\nOn November 23, Grant received word from Confederate deserters that Bragg was withdrawing some of his brigades. Upon seeing columns of Confederates marching away from Missionary Ridge, Grant became concerned that Bragg was sending troops to reinforce Confederates under General James Longstreet near Knoxville. In an effort to prevent this, Grant sent 14,000 Union troops to engage a rear-guard of 600 Confederates at Orchard Knob. The vastly outnumbered Rebels were able to get off only one volley before being overrun by the Federals. Orchard Knob served as Grant\u2019s headquarters for the remainder of the battle.\nThe next day, General Joseph Hooker struck the Confederate left at Lookout Mountain. Initially Grant did not view taking Lookout Mountain as a priority; however at the time of attack Grant directed Hooker to push on to Point Lookout if it became practicable. Hooker had three divisions under his command led by Generals John W. Geary, Charles Cruft, and Peter J. Osterhaus. At 10:30, Geary\u2019s men made contact with Confederate General Edward Walthall\u2019s men one mile southwest of Point Lookout. The Confederates\u2019 inferior numbers were quickly driven back. At 1:00 P.M. Confederate General John C. Moore launched a counter-attack against the surging Union forces, but the Rebels found themselves severely outflanked and retreated through the fog. That night Bragg held a counsel with his generals and decided to withdraw from Lookout Mountain to reinforce Missionary Ridge, giving Grant the second victory of the battle.\nInitially, Granted wished for General William T. Sherman to attack Missionary Ridge in coordination with Hooker\u2019s attack at Lookout Mountain. However, faulty intelligence led Sherman\u2019s men to Billy Goat Hill, which was physically separated from Missionary Ridge.\u00a0 Undaunted, Grant determined to follow up the success of November 24, with a coordinated effort the following day.\u00a0 Hooker would advance on Missionary Ridge from the south while Sherman would attack Tunnel Hill, on the northern end of the Confederate position.\u00a0 Thomas\u2019 Army of the Cumberland was arrayed against the center of Bragg\u2019s line to offer assistance as needed.\nOn November 25, Sherman\u2019s men experienced early successes, but a counter-attack from the Confederates routed the exhausted Federals.\u00a0 The attack on Tunnel Hill came to a halt at 4:00 P.M. On the Confederate left, Hooker found more success than Sherman. After arriving at Rossville Gap, the southernmost point of Missionary Ridge, Hooker launched a three-pronged attack that left the surprised Confederate troops surrounded and they quickly surrendered. At 2:30 P.M.\u00a0 Grant ordered Thomas to demonstrate against the Confederate center, and draw Bragg\u2019s attention away from Sherman. Gen. Thomas deployed 24,000 men against rifle pits at the base of the Ridge. The Union soldiers charged against the pits and successfully overran the 9,000 defenders. Despite Grant\u2019s orders to the contrary, Thomas\u2019 men continued their charge, swarmed over the ridge, and overwhelmed the Confederate defenders.\u00a0 With no tactical reserve in place, the thinly-manned Confederate line broke and fled from Missionary Ridge thus ending the siege of Chattanooga.\nUnion possession of Chattanooga opened up the Deep South for a Union invasion.

Into that gap Union General George Custer thrust his horsemen. Making matters worse Union General Horatio Wright's Sixth Corps was approaching from the east. With Yankee cavalry blocking the road to Farmville and infantry nipping at its heels, a sizable portion of Lee's army was caught in a vice.\nAfter the alarm at Holt\u2019s Corner, Gordon's corps and the supply train were diverted to the north in the hopes of joining the rest of the army. With the Union Second Corps in close pursuit, Gordon made a series of stands on high ground as the train withdrew. When supply wagons became bottle-necked at the Double Bridges over Sailor's Creek, the Federals got within striking distance. At around 5 PM, Humphreys\u2019 attacked and the bulk of Gordon's force was driven to the opposite bank before darkness ended the fighting on this part of the field. Further to the south, Anderson and Ewell deployed on high ground between Little Sailor's Creek and Marshall's Crossroads. Ewell's divisions dug in facing northeast, toward the Hillsman farm. Extending the Confederate line to the south and west were two more divisions. The Confederate line was practically back-to-back and thus the disparate units were unable help one another.\nWright's corps formed opposite Ewell and used twenty pieces of artillery to shell the Rebel force. Unfortunately Ewell had no operational artillery. After a thirty-minute cannonade, one of Wright\u2019s divisions waded into the swollen waters of Little Sailor's Creek. Ewell's defenders let loose a volley that staggered a portion of the attacking force, which bolted for cover. Confederate General Stapleton Crutchfield seized this opportunity and led an impetuous counterattack spearheaded by his heavy artillery battalions. These artillerymen acting as infantry became embroiled in savage hand-to-hand combat that claimed Crutchfield\u2019s life. By now more Federals had crossed the stream and were advancing on Ewell\u2019s left. After another brutal melee, the Confederates began to surrender.\nAt Marshall's Crossroads, Anderson fared no better. General Wesley Merritt's Union cavalry pressed the Confederates on both flanks. Custer ordered a series of mounted assaults on General George Pickett's division while Union General George Crook's dismounted attacks put pressure on General Bushrod Johnson's men on the Confederate right. Custer's horsemen eventually broke through and Anderson's men began rushing for the rear or surrendering. Watching the battle from a distant knoll, Robert E. Lee was heard to exclaim, \"My God! Has the army dissolved?\"\nThat evening, Phil Sheridan reported his success to Grant saying, \"If the thing is pressed I think that Lee will surrender.\" When word of this reached Abraham Lincoln, the president responded, \"Let the thing be pressed.\"\nApril 6, 1865, came to be known as \"Black Thursday\" among the Confederates. In the three engagements along Sailor's Creek, Lee lost roughly one-fourth of his army, many of them captured. The Federals claimed 7,700 prisoners that day, including six generals, among them Ewell, Kershaw, and Robert E. Lee's eldest son, Custis. Lee wrote to President Jefferson Davis, \"a few more Sailor's Creeks and it will all be over.\" Lee surrendered three days later.", "union_casualties": "1150", "name": "Sailor's Creek", "id": "sailor-s-creek", "total_casualties": "9,980", "union_strength": "1", "battle_dates": "April 6, 1865", "confederate_casualties": "8830", "total_strength": "27,500", "result": "Union Victory", "confederate_strength": "1", "campaign": "Appomattox Campaign", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/sailor-s-creek.html", "location": "Amelia County, Prince Edward County, and Nottoway County , Virginia", "union_commanders": [{"name": "Philip Sheridan", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/phillip-sheridan.html"}], "alternate_names": "Sayler's Creek, Little Sailor's Creek, Marshall's Crossroads", "confederate_commanders": [{"name": "Richard S.

Robert Anderson and his force of 85 soldiers were positioned at Fort Moultrie near the mouth of Charleston Harbor. On December 26, fearing for the safety of his men, Anderson moved his command to Fort Sumter, an imposing fortification in the middle of the harbor. While politicians and military commanders wrote and screamed about the legality and appropriateness of this provocative move, Anderson\u2019s position became perilous. Just after the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln on March 4, 1861, Anderson reported that he had only a six week supply of food left in the fort and Confederate patience for a foreign force in its territory was wearing thin.\nOn Thursday, April 11, 1861, Confederate Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard dispatched aides to Maj. Anderson to demand the fort\u2019s surrender. Anderson refused. The next morning, at 4:30 a.m., Confederate batteries opened fire on Fort Sumter and continued for 34 hours. The Civil War had begun!\u00a0 Anderson did not return the fire for the first two hours. The fort's supply of ammunition was not suited for an equal fight and Anderson lacked fuses for his exploding shells--only solid shot could be used against the Rebel batteries. At about 7:00 A.M., Union Capt.\u00a0Abner Doubleday, the fort's second in command, was afforded the honor of firing the first shot in defense of the fort.\nThe firing continued all day, although much less rapidly since the Union fired aimed to conserve ammunition. \"The crashing of the shot, the bursting of the shells, the falling of the walls, and the roar of the flames, made a pandemonium of the fort,\" wrote Doubleday. The fort's large flag staff was struck and the colors fell to the ground and a brave lieutenant, Norman J. Hall,\u00a0bravely exposed himself to enemy fire as he put the Stars and Stripes back up. That evening, the firing was sporadic with but an occasional round landing on or in Fort Sumter.\nOn Saturday, April 13, Anderson surrendered the fort. Incredibly, no soldiers were killed in battle. The generous terms of surrender, however, allowed Anderson to perform a 100-gun salute before he and his men evacuated the fort the next day. The salute began at 2:00 P.M. on April 14, but was cut short to 50 guns after an accidental explosion killed one of the gunners and mortally wounded another. Carrying their tattered banner, the men marched out of the fort and boarded a boat that ferried them to the Union ships outside the harbor.

While the Union Navy had established a blockade at the port, Mobile Bay\u2019s formidable defenses prevented the navy from closing the net too tightly, and rebel smugglers continued to slip in and out.\nThe bay had two main channels of entry defended by three forts, the largest being Fort Morgan \u2013 a 45-gun, star-shaped fortification protecting the largest channel. To supplement these defenses, the Confederates had filled parts of the channel with torpedoes (which today would be called sea mines), and assembled a small flotilla of one ironclad, the C.S.S. Tennessee, and three gunboats. The fleet was commanded by veteran seaman Adm. Franklin Buchanan \u2013 who had earned his place in history commanding C.S.S. Virginia on the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads. Tasked with closing the port was David G. Farragut, who had become the United States\u2019 first admiral after his capture of New Orleans two years previous. Farragut assembled a fleet consisting of four ironclad monitors and more than a dozen wooden ships. At 7:00 a.m. on August 5, 1864, the Federals rushed into the harbor.\nFarragut split his fleet into two columns \u2013 the ironclads sailing nearest Fort Morgan, and the wooden ships on the far side. Farragut ordered the larger wooden ships lashed side by side to a smaller ship so that the bigger vessels could serve as a shield, and so the ships would be able to tow each other if one became crippled. Farragut personally observed much of the battle while lashed to the rigging on his flagship U.S.S. Hartford.\nInitially, the ships began sailing through the narrow width of the channel that had not been mined \u2013 passing under the guns of the fort. But as the columns maneuvered, the ships found themselves drifting into the edge of the minefield. The ironclad U.S.S. Tecumseh struck a torpedo, and sank almost instantly, and cautious Union captains began stopping their ships while still within range of Fort Morgan. At this juncture, Farragut is said to have ordered Hartford forward with the famous line \"Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!\" (although more reliable accounts suggest a slight variation to this quote).\nAlthough they faced bombardment from the fort and the Confederate ships, Farragut\u2019s flagship made it through the minefield in one piece, with the rest of the fleet following his path. Once into the expansive bay, the fleet could easily move out of range of Fort Morgan\u2019s guns, leaving only the Confederate ships to contend with. The Federals quickly captured or drove away the Rebel gunboats, but despite the overwhelming odds the Tennessee, Buchanan\u2019s flag ship, raced out to meet the Northerners head on.\nBuchanan was soon surrounded by the Union ironclads as he steered for the Hartford, but the Tennessee\u2019s armored plating protected her as she was repeatedly rammed and pounded with shot. However, the ship\u2019s weak engine \u2013 a product of the Confederacy\u2019s limited industrial capacity \u2013 made her too slow to outmaneuver her adversaries, and prevented her from successfully ramming any of the Union ships \u2013 although she came close, sliding alongside Hartford as the two crews fired at near point-blank range.\nEventually, however, the Rebels\u2019 slow engine, bad gunpowder, and numerical disadvantage took their toll. Buchanan was injured and the ship\u2019s rudder chains were cut \u2013 preventing her from steering, and allowing the Federals to move away from her guns and continue pummeling the Tennessee in relative safety. Three hours after the fighting had started, C.S.S. Tennessee surrendered, leaving the harbor in Union control, and closing the port to Southern blockade runners. The city of Mobile itself was too well defended to capture, but several weeks of joint Army-Navy operations managed to capture Fort Morgan and the other forts protecting the harbor. All told, the Union suffered over 300 casualties in the fighting compared to less than 50 for the Confederates, although by the time the forts surrendered, 1,500 Southerners had been captured.", "union_casualties": "322", "name": "Mobile Bay", "id": "mobile-bay", "total_casualties": "1,822", "union_strength": null, "battle_dates": "August 2 - 23, 1864", "confederate_casualties": "1500", "total_strength": "", "result": "Union Victory", "confederate_strength": null, "campaign": null, "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/mobile-bay.html", "location": "Mobile and Baldwin County, Alabama", "union_commanders": [{"name": "David G.

The first Union objective was Port Gibson, roughly ten miles east of Bruinsburg and commanding the best approach route to Vicksburg. First Sergeant Charles Hobbs of the 99th Illinois recorded of his experience that night: \u201cAs we pass along an old darkey gives us his blessings, but fears there will be few of us ever to return. The moon is shining above us and the road is romantic in the extreme. The artillery wagons rattle forward and the heavy tramp of many men gives a dull but impressive sound.\u201d The road over which the blue soldiers now marched led to the Shaifer House.\nConfederate Brig. Gen. Martin E. Green was inspecting his picket line at the Shaifer House shortly after midnight when he was amused to see Mrs. Shaifer and the women of the house frantically loading a wagon with all of their household items. The general tried to calm their fears by telling them that the enemy could not possibly arrive before daylight. Just then, a single shot rang out as the Confederate pickets spotted movement in the distance. The stillness of the night was shattered as a volley of musketry came in reply. Many of the bullets buried themselves in the wagon-load of furniture. The women were terrified and, screaming with fright, leaped into the wagon and whipped the animals toward Port Gibson. Green quickly mounted and raced back to Magnolia Church to alert his brigade. Fighting in the scattered fields and forest around the Shaifer House intensified as more Union regiments and batteries came into action. Night fighting such as this was rare in the Civil War as it was difficult to maintain command and control of the troops. Almost by mutual consent the fighting ebbed by 3 a.m. and the weary soldiers in blue and gray rested on their arms.\nAt dawn the battle was renewed in fury as Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand threw most of his XIII Corps toward Green\u2019s thin gray line. Green called for reinforcements from the force under Brig. Gen. Edward Tracy, which anchored the Confederate right flank roughly a mile and half to the northwest. Tracy dispatched infantry and artillery to Green\u2019s assistance minutes before cannons began to pound his own line, signaling the advance of a new Union column under Brig. Gen. Peter Osterhaus. Soon after, Tracy was killed by a sniper\u2019s bullet.\nDespite the reinforcements, Green was still heavily outnumbered and around ten o\u2019clock his line collapsed. As Green\u2019s men scrambled to the rear, Brig. Gen. John Bowen, in overall Confederate command on the field, worked feverishly to restore his line. The brigades of Brig. Gen. William Baldwin, just arriving from Vicksburg, and Col. Francis Cockrell\u2019s from Grand Gulf, were placed into position astride the road at White and Irwin\u2019s Branches of Willow Creek, a mile and a half east of Magnolia Church.\nThe Confederate right did not last long. Despite a valiant effort by Col. Isham W. Garrot, taking over for Tracy, his line was outflanked and he was forced to withdraw. His men fell back to the next ridge where early in the afternoon they were reinforced by what remained of Martin\u2019s Green\u2019s brigade. Rather than form on Garrott\u2019s endangered right, Green assumed position on his left and, thus, provided little support.\nThe Union troops pushed forward all along the line and fierce fighting continued throughout the afternoon.

In spite of this agreement, Col. Theodore H. Barrett, commanding forces at Brazos Santiago, Texas, dispatched an expedition, composed of 250 men of the 62nd U.S. Colored Infantry Regiment and 50 men of the 2nd Texas Cavalry Regiment under the command of Lt. Col. David Branson, to the mainland, on May 11, 1865, to attack reported Rebel outposts and camps. Prohibited by foul weather from crossing to Point Isabel as instructed, the expedition crossed to Boca Chica much later. At 2:00 am, on May 12, the expeditionary force surrounded the Rebel outpost at White\u2019s Ranch, but found no one there. Exhausted, having been up most of the night, Branson secreted his command in a thicket and among weeds on the banks of the Rio Grande and allowed his men to sleep. Around 8:30 am, people on the Mexican side of the river informed the Rebels of the Federals\u2019 whereabouts. Branson promptly led his men off to attack a Confederate camp at Palmito Ranch. After much skirmishing along the way, the Federals attacked the camp and scattered the Confederates. Branson and his men remained at the site to feed themselves and their horses but, at 3:00 pm, a sizable Confederate force appeared, influencing the Federals to retire to White\u2019s Ranch. He sent word of his predicament to Barrett, who reinforced Branson at daybreak, on the 13th, with 200 men of the 34th Indiana Volunteer Infantry. The augmented force, now commanded by Barrett, started out towards Palmito Ranch, skirmishing most of the way. At Palmito Ranch, they destroyed the rest of the supplies not torched the day before and continued on. A few miles forward, they became involved in a sharp firefight. After the fighting stopped, Barrett led his force back to a bluff at Tulosa on the river where the men could prepare dinner and camp for the night. At 4:00 pm, a large Confederate cavalry force, commanded by Col. John S. \u201cRip\u201d Ford, approached, and the Federals formed a battle line. The Rebels hammered the Union line with artillery. To preclude an enemy flanking movement, Barrett ordered a retreat. The retreat was orderly and skirmishers held the Rebels at a respectable distance. Returning to Boca Chica at 8:00 pm, the men embarked at 4:00 am, on the 14th. This was the last battle in the Civil War. Native, African, and Hispanic Americans were all involved in the fighting.

Jackson, however, could not pass on a chance to defeat the Union columns in detail as they approached, one on either side of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. On June 8, Jackson\u2019s men dealt a severe blow to Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont's Yankees at Cross Keys, on the west side of the fork.\nThat same day, Union cavalry crossed over from the east side of the fork and raided Jackson\u2019s headquarters at Port Republic. In a brief skirmish the Yankees nearly captured Jackson and, for a time, controlled the vital North Bridge over the South Fork.

Tyler judiciously placed his artillery here, giving the Yankee gunners command of nearly their entire front which consisted primarily of an open field between the River Road and the South Fork.

Thick woods shielded the Southerners' approach, allowing the 2nd and 4th Virginia to advance directly upon the Union gunners at the Coaling. The Virginians seized control of Tyler\u2019s artillery platform only to be confronted by an onslaught of Federal infantry. After a vicious hand-to-hand struggle, the Confederates were forced to relinquish control of the guns while they waited for their own reinforcements. When help finally arrived in the form of Brig. Gen. Richard Taylor's Louisiana brigade, the Southerners again charged the Coaling, this time taking it in flank. This was too much for Tyler's men, who hastily fled down the reverse slope.

Rather than attack the Confederates directly, Sherman directed his forces toward Dallas, 15 miles southwest of the pass, in a wide flanking march. All six Union infantry corps and cavalry crossed the Etowah at four points west of Cartersville and south of Kingston during May 23-24.\nAlmost as soon as the Federals started moving, Johnston knew they would not attack him at Allatoona, and were heading toward Dallas. He ordered Hardee\u2019s and Polk\u2019s corps to start marching there, but kept Hood at Allatoona for a day to make sure the Yankees had left. Hood marched to join the rest of the army on the 24th and took position on the right of the Confederate line here, at New Hope Church. The next day Hood learned from a prisoner that Geary's division and the rest of Hooker's Twentieth Corps were headed his way. The Confederates dug in or built log and rock parapets.

Despite skepticism, apathy, and outright opposition from Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, Pleasants began digging on June 25, completing a 510-foot shaft within three weeks. By July 27, the mine was packed with 8,000 pounds of gunpowder and ready to ignite.\nInitially, the Union high command placed little stock in the mine\u2019s potential. But by the end of July, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant had decided to authorize the explosion and use it to capture Petersburg in a spectacular coup de main. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside\u2019s plan was to pass his leading division through the gap created by the explosion and then have his troops turn north and south respectively to widen the breach, and clear the way to the vital Jerusalem Plank Road. The Ninth Corps commander chose Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero\u2019s division of black troops to spearhead the assault. Though these troops had spent most of their service guarding wagon trains and building fortifications, Burnside believed their enthusiasm would compensate for their lack of combat experience. What\u2019s more, each brigade in Ferrero\u2019s division trained for its role in Burnside\u2019s carefully choreographed scheme.\nOn the day before the assault, however, General Meade ordered Burnside to select a white unit instead.

Paralyzed by contradictory orders and a lack of leadership, the Federals failed to either widen the breach or rush toward the high ground at Blandford Church, the attack\u2019s ultimate target. Instead, many Yankee soldiers plunged into the Crater or froze in positions on either side of it. Reinforcements merely added to the lack of command and control.\nBut Union incompetence is only part of the story. The Confederate defenders on either side of the Crater recovered quickly after their initial shock and poured fire from both flanks into Burnside\u2019s men. Well-placed artillery raked the ground on all sides of the Crater. An indecipherable labyrinth of trenches, bombproofs, and covered ways also served to freeze the attackers in place.\nShortly after he learned of the explosion, Gen. Robert E. Lee called for fresh troops to regain the lost ground. The only available reinforcements belonged to Maj. Gen. William Mahone\u2019s division, posted two-and-a-half miles west of the Crater. Mahone selected two of his five brigades\u2014a Georgia unit and his own Virginia Brigade, which included many men from Petersburg\u2014to make the march. Utilizing stream beds, back roads, and covered ways to avoid detection, Mahone reached the scene at about 8:30 a.m.\nThe Virginians were the first to charge, their zeal for combat sharpened by the presence of United States Colored Troops. The black soldiers, among the last of Burnside\u2019s men to occupy the Crater, had shouted \"No Quarter\" during their attack, and Mahone\u2019s men prepared to fight on that basis.\nCharging across the open ground in a compact formation with bayonets fixed, the Virginians reached the edge of the Crater, where they unleashed a deadly volley. The combat became hand-to-hand and men died in heaps, human gore running in streams to the bottom of the horrid pit. The black troops suffered disproportionately as they became special targets for the Confederates. Many were killed after they had surrendered. The Virginians managed to recapture most of the line north of the Crater. The Georgia brigade attacked next, but they made scant progress against the remaining Union defenders.\nBy then Mahone had summoned to the battlefield a third brigade of Alabama troops under Brig. Gen. John C. C. Sanders. At 1:30 p.m. some 630 Confederates dashed across this field to finish the job the Virginians had started. Many of the remaining Federals now retreated, but others fought, died, or were captured. When the firing stopped, some 3,800 Federals were casualties. The Confederates lost fewer than 1,200 men, including those killed by the explosion.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "Ambrose E.

Sherman, therefore, decided to move six of his seven infantry corps against the supply lines.

Sherman drove northward into the Carolinas, splitting his force into two parts. Major General Henry W. Slocum commanded the left wing, while Major General Oliver O. Howard commanded the right. The plan was to march through the Carolinas, destroying railroads and disrupting supply lines, before joining Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s army near Richmond. On March 19th, as the respective wings approached Goldsboro, North Carolina, Slocum\u2019s wing encountered the entrenched Confederates of Joseph E. Johnston, who had concentrated at Bentonville with the hope of slowing the Union advance.\nConvinced that he faced only a small Confederate cavalry force, Slocum launched a probing attack, which was quickly driven back. In the late afternoon, the Confederate trap was sprung, and a division of rebel infantry under Major General Robert Hoke attacked, driving back Slocum\u2019s men and overrunning the Union XIV Corps field hospital. However, James D. Morgan\u2019s Union division held out against the onslaught, and eventually Union reinforcements arrived to support the counterattack. The Confederates reached their high water mark at the Morris Farm, where Union forces formed a defensive line. After several Confederate attacks failed to dislodge the Union defenders, the weary rebels pulled back to their original lines. Nightfall brought the first day\u2019s fighting to a close in a tactical draw.\nThe next day, the right wing of the Union Army arrived to reinforce Slocum, which put the Confederates at a huge numerical disadvantage. Sherman expected Johnston to retreat and was inclined to let him do so. However, while Johnston did begin evacuating his wounded, he refused to give up his tenuous position, guarding his only route of escape across Mill Creek. His only hope for success in the face of such an overwhelming numerical disadvantage was to entice Sherman into attacking his entrenched position, something Sherman was unlikely to do. A few sporadic skirmishes occurred throughout the day on March 20th, but no major action ensued.\nOn the 21st, Johnston remained in position and the previous day\u2019s skirmishing resumed. Under a heavy rainfall, Union Major General Joseph A. Mower led a \u201clittle reconnaissance\u201d toward the Mill Creek Bridge. When Mower discovered the weakness of the Confederate left flank, that little reconnaissance became a full-scale attack against the small force holding the bridge. A Confederate counterattack, combined with Sherman\u2019s order for Mower to withdraw, ended the advance, allowing Johnston\u2019s army to retain control of their only means of supply and retreat. Had the Federals managed to gain control of this bridge, they might have had the chance to end the campaign earlier or even capture Johnston\u2019s army entirely.\nInstead, the Confederates pulled back across the bridge on the night of the 21st, effectively ending the battle. Union forces pursued them at first light but were halted by a severe skirmish at Hannah\u2019s Creek. After regrouping at Goldsboro, Sherman pursued Johnston\u2019s army toward Raleigh.\u00a0 On April 18, Johnston signed an armistice with Sherman at the Bennett House, and on April 26, formally surrendered his army.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "William T.

Gen. Quincy Gillmore was assigned to lead the 1863 campaign against the city of Charleston, South Carolina. Gillmore, who graduated first in his West Point class of 1849, was a rising star within the Union ranks.\nGillmore\u2019s plan, supported by a heavy naval presence, was to seize Morris Island so that he could place heavy rifled guns on Cummings Point that would in turn eliminate the Confederate stronghold at nearby Fort Sumter. Once Sumter was reduced, the army and the navy could move swiftly to capture Charleston, the birthplace of the rebellion.\nOn July 10, 1863, Gillmore\u2019s Federal soldiers landed on the southern end of Morris Island and quickly pushed back the meager Confederate forces holding that part of the island. Unfortunately for the Northerners, this swift amphibious attack had failed to capture all of Morris Island. The Confederate defenders, now reinforced, still occupied Fort Wagner, a stronghold created out of sand, earth, and palmetto logs.\u00a0\nHoping to finish the capture of Morris Island the next morning, Brig. Gen. George Strong sent forth the 7th Connecticut, 76th Pennsylvania, and 9th Maine in an early morning attack upon Fort Wagner. This precipitous attack against Fort Wagner was driven back with heavy loss.\nThe undeterred Federals prepared for a new and better coordinated attack upon Fort Wagner. The new plan included a close range land and sea bombardment of the fort, followed by a land assault by 5,000 soldiers.\nFacing the Federal onslaught were more than 1,620 Confederate soldiers under the command of Brig. Gen. William Taliaferro. Fort Wagner bristled with 14 heavy guns, mortars, and carronades, and field pieces situated amongst a well laid out fortress, designed to withstand modern rifled artillery fire.\n\nOn July 18, 1863, after the heavy land and sea bombardment subsided, Gillmore sent forward his Federal regiments. The assault was led by the 54th Massachusetts regiment; a Boston regiment filled with free African-Americans, and led by the Harvard educated Col. Robert Gould Shaw. The decision to have the 54th Massachusetts lead this dangerous attack was fraught with all sorts of political and military risk, but in the end it was Shaw\u2019s men that led the attack up the narrow beach.\nAs the Federal soldiers neared the fort they were subjected to artillery and musket fire that shredded the exposed Yankee ranks. Despite their heavy losses, the remnants of the 54th Massachusetts reached and scaled the earthen walls of Fort Wagner. Descending into the fort, the 54th engaged in a bloody hand-to-hand struggle with the Confederate defenders. \u00a0Col. Shaw, shouting \u201cOnward boys!

Faced with a stinging defeat, the surviving Federal soldiers streamed back to their positions south of the fort late in the evening of July 18th. \u00a0Federal casualties reached 1,515, with the 54th Massachusetts losing 42% of its ranks in the attack. General Strong and Colonels Shaw, Putnam, and Chatfield all were killed or mortally wounded in the attack.

Having witnessed the disastrous attempt to force a crossing at Fredericksburg at the end of the December previous, newly installed Major General \u201cFightin\u2019\u201d Joe Hooker now sought to outflank the Confederate army by way of the river\u2019s western fords. The opening battle of this new campaign, at Kelly\u2019s Ford on March 17, would be his first move in pursuit of this goal.\nHooker\u2019s ultimate objective\u2014to deliver a crushing, war-ending defeat to Robert E. Lee in open battle\u2014had required a complete structural overhaul of the Army of the Potomac. One of the main features of his plan was a reorganization of the army\u2019s cavalry wing. Up to this point in the war the Confederate cavalry had simply dominated its Union counterpart. One Federal cavalryman claimed that there were only three choices when facing Confederates on horseback: \u201csurrender, die, or run.\u201d Wanting to give his troopers a few more choices, Hooker drew inspiration from J.E.B. Stuart and formed his cavalry into a single, powerful corps under George Stoneman. Where before the Union cavalry had been dispersed throughout the army, each small group taking orders from a different officer, now thousands of horsemen would be acting as one body. Hooker hoped that this, in addition to an infusion of quick-shooting and accurate breech-loading carbines, would give his cavalry the muscle necessary to turn the tables on the Confederates.\u00a0\nIt was not long before the Union cavalrymen received an opportunity to test their mettle. At the end of February, Confederate horsemen under the command Fitzhugh Lee conducted a daring raid north of the Rappahannock.\u00a0 Lee, the commanding general\u2019s nephew, captured men and horses, stole supplies, and left a note for William Averell, an old friend from West Point who was now a Union cavalry officer. The note read: \u201cI wish you would put up your sword, leave my state, and go home. You ride a good horse, I ride a better. If you won't go home, return my visit, and bring me a sack of coffee.\u201d\nAverell was furious and his mood blackened further after receiving a vicious reprimand from Joe Hooker. On March 16, he set out to \u201crout or destroy\u201d Fitzhugh Lee and his command as they sheltered south of the river near Culpeper Courthouse. He took with him some 3,100 troopers, telling them to sharpen their sabers and expect a victory. By nightfall the advance elements of the northern forces had quietly reached Kelly\u2019s Ford. This shallow run would be the starting point for the next day\u2019s battle. Averell picked 100 men who would lead the attack to the opposite bank at first light on the 17th.\u00a0\nThe first assault was stopped cold by 85 Confederate sharpshooters sheltering in rifle pits along the southern bank. Major Samuel E. Chamberlain rallied the Union troopers and led three more charges across the ford, all of which were turned back. Chamberlain himself was wounded twice in the face. The fifth charge, led by men of the 1st Rhode Island and supported by the fire of Averell\u2019s main body, which had by now arrived at the battlefield, finally overwhelmed the defenders. By 7:30 A.M. 2,000 Union cavalrymen had crossed the Rappahannock and were at large in Confederate territory. Rallying some 800 Confederate troopers, Fitzhugh Lee galloped to the battlefield, and to the attack. J.E.B. Stuart heard the sound of guns and came to observe the fighting. So too did John Pelham, a brilliant young artillerist with a thirst for battle.\nAverell knew his old friend\u2019s aggressive bent. The Union men advanced slowly, maintaining a strong defensive front. The two forces collided in the farm fields of C.T. Wheatley, 2 miles northwest of Kelly\u2019s Ford.\u00a0 Averell deployed his men with one flank behind a stone wall and the other in a dense woodlot. Lee ordered a charge on the stone wall. With Pelham in their midst, the 3rd Virginia gave a loud whoop and touched spurs to their horses. Crossing the field under a heavy fire from Union carbines and freshly deployed artillery, the Virginia troopers found the wall too high to jump. After emptying their revolvers at close range they were forced back. Pelham was carried back to the lines, unconscious. The tiny shell fragment lodged in his brain would kill him within hours.\u00a0\nOn his own initiative, Union Colonel Alfred Duffi\u00e9, watching from the woods on the left flank, chose this moment to launch a counterattack. His cavalry thundered towards the Confederate line. Taken by surprise, Lee\u2019s troopers retreated through the woods a mile further to the northwest to a position behind a small stream known as Carter\u2019s Run. The Union men cautiously pursued. Averell had just heard a locomotive whistle in the distance and thought it signaled the arrival of southern reinforcements. \nLee ordered another charge as the blue line came into view in the trees. Averell met the charge defensively and the Confederate troopers were once again staggered backwards by the Union carbines. At this moment, around 5:30 P.M., Averell had a significant numerical advantage over an enemy much disordered by the day\u2019s violent failures, but his nerve failed him. He ordered a withdrawal back to the northern side of the Rappahannock, and thus failed to provide the victory he had promised.\u00a0 He did take the time to leave a message behind: \u201cDear Fitz, Here\u2019s your coffee, Here\u2019s your visit.\u00a0 How do you like it?\u201d\nThe Battle of Kelly\u2019s Ford was the first large all-cavalry action of the war and it had significant consequences. The loss of Pelham cut short a wildly promising career\u2014the potential impact of such a high-caliber artillerist on the battlefields of 1863 is incalculable.\u00a0 Additionally, while Averell\u2019s ultimate timidity prevented a signal victory, for the first time Union cavalrymen had one in their grasp. The battle proved that Hooker\u2019s unified and well-equipped cavalry was a force to be reckoned with, and one that would greatly strengthen his hand in the Chancellorsville Campaign.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "William W.

Van Dorn was senior officer and took command of the combined force numbering about 22,000 men. The Rebels marched to Pocahontas on October 1, and then moved southeast toward Corinth. They hoped to seize Corinth and then sweep into Middle Tennessee. Since the Siege of Corinth, in the spring, Union forces had erected various fortifications, an inner and intermediate line, to protect Corinth, an important transportation center. With the Confederate approach, the Federals, numbering about 23,000, occupied the outer line of fortifications and placed men in front of them. Van Dorn arrived within three miles of Corinth at 10:00 am on October 3, and moved into some fieldworks that the Confederates had erected for the siege of Corinth. The fighting began, and the Confederates steadily pushed the Yankees rearward. A gap occurred between two Union brigades which the Confederates exploited around 1:00 pm. The Union troops moved back in a futile effort to close the gap. Price then attacked and drove the Federals back further to their inner line. By evening, Van Dorn was sure that he could finish the Federals off during the next day. This confidence--combined with the heat, fatigue, and water shortages--persuaded him to cancel any further operations that day.

Lee bold. In addition to advancing his army into Maryland, Lee divided his invasion forced and sent a large portion of it to seize the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. However, his opponent, Gen. George B. McClellan, was given a mislaid copy of one of Lee's orders that revealed the Virginian's plans and troop positions. Aware that a portion of Lee's army was now vulnerable to attack, McClellan advanced on South Mountain.\u00a0\nOnly a small Confederate force under D.H. Hill protected Turner's and Fox's Gaps, two vital passes through the South Mountain range. Early on September 14, Gen. Jacob D. Cox's division of the Union Ninth Corps launched an attack against Samuel Garland's brigade at Fox's Gap. Cox's 3,000 Ohioans overran Garland's North Carolinians, driving the Southerners from behind a stone wall and mortally wounding Gen. Garland. With Fox's Gap all but clear, Cox awaited reinforcements to further his gains.\u00a0\nSupport, however, was not forthcoming. Despite having the strategic and numerical advantage over his opponent\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014a spirit of leisure seemed to pervade McClellan's headquarters, where the commanding general determined to let his subordinates direct the unfolding battle. Making matters worse, the usually aggressive Ninth Corps head, Gen. Jesse L. Reno, was slow to send reinforcements to Fox's Gap, thus allowing additional troops from Gen. James Longstreet's command to shore up the Confederate positions on South Mountain. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, in turn, chose to wait for the arrival of Joseph Hooker's First Corps before making a concerted effort to seize the mountain passes. An uncoordinated Confederate counterattack foundered in the region's confusing thickets. By now, both side had received reinforcements as the battle for control of South Mountain escalated.\u00a0\nWhile Union and Confederate commanders funneled troops into Fox's and Turner's Gaps, excessive caution plagued Gen. William B. Franklin's Federal Sixth Corps on its way to relieve the besieged garrison at Harpers Ferry. Roughly one thousand Confederates held Crampton's Gap, yet Franklin was convinced the Rebels were in strong enough force to delay the advance of his 12,000-man corps. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, however, felt differently. At around 4 p.m., Slocum's division of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania troops charged headlong up the slope and into Crampton's Gap, dislodging the outnumbered Confederates from the protection of a stone fence. Even the arrival of two Georgia regiments under Howell Cobb did little to stem the Union tide. A second attack drove the remaining Confederates down the western slope of South Mountain, leaving the Sixth Corps in possession of Crampton's Gap. But with daylight fading and Confederate reinforcements forming in the distance, Franklin halted his column.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, at Turner's Gap, Hooker's corps had arrived on the field and Burnside was finally ready to launch a coordinated assault, At 4 p.m. - seven hours after the fighting began - Union divisions under generals George Meade and John P. Hatch made a relentless charge on the northern end of Turner's Gap. The brunt of the Federal onslaught fell upon the 1,200 men of Brig. Gen. Robert Rodes' brigade, whose regiments suffered severe casualties during the struggle. Meade's Pennsylvania Reserves' well-directed attack pressed the Confederate left flank while Hatch's troops advanced on their right. Only the timely arrival of reinforcements from Longstreet prevented the Confederate line from collapsing. After a brutal firefight along a cornfield fence, Hatch broke through the Rebel line but darkness prevented the capture of Turner's Gap.\u00a0\n\nBack at Fox's Gap, the reunited Ninth Corps mounted a separate effort to seize control of Turner's Gap but rain into stiff resistance from Confederate divisions under generals John B. Hood and D.H. Hill. Casualties mounted, among them Gen. Reno, who was shot down in almost the same spot as Samuel Garland had been that morning. A diversionary attack by Gen. John Gibbon's \"Black Hat Brigade\" produced only more bloodshed. As the sun set over South Mountain, the exhausted Confederates still maintained control of Turner's Gap.\u00a0\nThough Lee, Longstreet, and D.H. Hill agreed to abandon South Mountain before daylight on September 15, the blood, day-long struggle bought the Confederate army valuable time to consolidate its position\u2014and ready itself for the coming battle along Antietam Creek.

Grant was searching for ways to thin and break the Confederate lines around the vital city. He opted to revisit an operation he had attempted against Vicksburg the previous summer\u2014mining, igniting, and destroying a section of the Petersburg fortifications in preparation for an infantry assault.\nThe bomb was set to go off on July 30. To further weaken the Confederate defenses, Grant ordered a series of diversionary maneuvers to take place in the days before the main attack. One of these expeditions resulted in the Battle of First Deep Bottom.\nEarly on July 27, Winfield Scott Hancock\u2019s II Corps, along with two divisions of Phil Sheridan\u2019s cavalry, left the lines around Petersburg and moved north, crossing the James River near a sharp bend known locally as Deep Bottom. Their objective was to threaten Richmond and compel Robert E. Lee to dispatch a substantial portion of the Petersburg defenders in order to check the advance.\nLee had no choice but to act to defend the capital city, sending six brigades north to fortify the New Market Heights. From this eminence the Confederates covered the Union army\u2019s likely approaches to Richmond.\nIn order to threaten Richmond, Grant had outlined two possible scenarios for operational success. The first scenario was for Hancock\u2019s infantry to pin down the Confederate defenders so decisively that Sheridan\u2019s cavalry could wheel around the battle and ransack the city itself. The second scenario was for Hancock\u2019s infantry to pin down enough of the Confederate defenders to allow Sheridan to ride west of Richmond and strike the railroad supply lines from the Shenandoah Valley.\nThe July 27 advance began well for Hancock\u2019s expeditionary force. His lead elements managed to scatter a Confederate outpost blocking his route north and even captured four cannons. Hancock exploited this advantage, moving the rest of his men across the James and deploying them for an advance west to Richmond, which was approximately nine miles away.\nThe Confederates had also reshuffled their line to follow a watercourse known as Bailey\u2019s Creek, which ran north-south between the contending forces. Hancock reacted to this by dispatching Sheridan\u2019s cavalry to Gravel Hill, a position that could be used as a stepping stone around the northern extremity of the creek.\nThe 10th and 50th Georgia regiments attacked the Union cavalry on Gravel Hill and drove them back after a sharp firefight. Repeating carbines, which by mid-1864 were in the hands of many Northern cavalrymen, took a heavy toll on the Georgians. The struggle on Gravel Hill was the last major action of the day, as Hancock chose to conduct further reconnaissance before sending his infantry across Bailey\u2019s Creek.\nOn July 28, both sides received reinforcements from the Petersburg sector. Having initiated the battle with an eye towards thinning the Petersburg defenses, Grant was no doubt pleased to hear that more Confederates, two more divisions, had arrived on the Deep Bottom battlefield.\nHancock received one brigade from Petersburg, which he used to replace John Gibbon\u2019s elite division along Bailey\u2019s Creek. Gibbon\u2019s men had not yet redeployed when Phil Sheridan ordered his horsemen forward to attack Gravel Hill once again.\nThe Union cavalry ran headlong into three Confederate brigades that were in the middle of launching an assault of their own. The Confederates gained the initial advantage, but were ultimately driven back by a determined line of dismounted cavalry firing their repeaters from the crest of a gentle slope. The Union men remounted and pursued, capturing nearly 200 prisoners and ending major fighting on the 28th.\nHancock coordinated a withdrawal back across the James late on July 29. While the fighting at Deep Bottom had mostly gone to the Federal advantage, further operations against the Confederate defenses north of the James would require more blood and iron than Grant saw fit to divert at that time. The Battle of First Deep Bottom had succeeded in its primary objective\u2014that of drawing Confederates away from the Petersburg defenses before the bomb was triggered.

Meade\u2019s Army of the Potomac in early October, Confederate General Robert E. Lee\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia retreated south of the Rappahannock River to maintain a defensive line against Federal troops. After burning the Orange & Alexandria railroad in his army\u2019s retreat, Lee set up redoubts along the north bank of the Rappahannock River in late October. Lee had hoped his position on the Rappahannock would force Meade to divide his army should the Union general decide to attack. Though Meade divided his forces just as Lee anticipated, much of the subsequent action of the battle did not go as Lee had expected.\nWith pressure from his superiors in Washington to attack Lee\u2019s army, Meade ordered an assault on Confederate lines on November 7th, using a two-pronged approach. General William H. French\u2019s Third Corps would attack Lee at Kelly\u2019s Ford while General John Sedgwick\u2019s Sixth Corps struck the Confederate bridgehead at Rappahannock Station. Aware that Meade had divided his army, Lee sent General Robert Rodes to meet the threat at Kelly\u2019s Ford, leaving General Jubal A. Early to keep Sedgwick at bay.\nFrench\u2019s men easily overwhelmed the Confederates\u2019 meager defenses at Kelly\u2019s Ford in the early afternoon, capturing around 300 Confederates in the process. Meanwhile at Rappahannock Station, Sedgwick\u2019s right wing advanced toward Rebel redoubts. Though Early called for reinforcements, Lee only sent one brigade, led by Colonel Archibald Godwin, to assist the hard-pressed Brigadier General Henry T. Hays\u2019 brigade of \u201cLouisiana Tigers,\u201d regiments appropriately dubbed for their ferocity in battle.\nGodwin and Hays\u2019 men found themselves in the midst of heavy and rapid enemy fire as Sedgwick worked his way around both rebel flanks and attacked Confederate redoubts. Sedgwick\u2019s guns and Confederate batteries maintained an active fire until dusk. Lulled by the \u201clateness of the hour\u201d and the quieting of gunfire, Confederates mistakenly believed that no further attacks would be attempted until the morning light.\nSuddenly, out of the shadows of the night, Brigadier General David A. Russell\u2019s division led a brutal bayonet assault on Rebel forces. Unprepared for such an attack, many Southerners simply ran off, but enough came together to fight the enemy in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Russell\u2019s lead regiment, the 6th Maine, along with their reinforcements, the 5th Wisconsin, resisted the Louisiana Tigers\u2019 counterattack. By the end of the fight, Russell\u2019s men had overrun the Confederate bridgehead at Rappahannock Station and taken more than 1,600 of Early\u2019s men prisoner.\nSouth of the battle, winds stifled the sounds of the fight, leaving Confederate high command to find out only too late of the severity of the attack. Fear of further defeat and capture prevented their directing aid in repelling Federal troops near the station. On both fronts\u2014Kelly\u2019s Ford and Rappahannock Station\u2014Lee\u2019s army suffered over 2,000 casualties.

Sherman\u2019s attention from the tender underbelly of the Confederacy by threatening his supply base at Nashville. Sherman did not take the bait, and instead dispatched General John Schofield\u2019s Army of the Ohio, 30,000 strong, to protect Nashville while the rest of Sherman\u2019s army simply left their supply line behind and marched to the Atlantic coast, forcibly securing whatever they needed to sustain themselves from the Confederate citizens in their path.\n25,000 Union soldiers under George Thomas were entrenched in Nashville. If Schofield could reach them before Hood, then he would enjoy a commanding numerical advantage on the battlefield. Hood\u2019s hopes for a successful campaign rested on defeating Schofield before the two forces joined. After a month of sparring along the Tennessee and the Duck Rivers, on November 28 Hood managed to divide Schofield\u2019s army and surround a portion of it in the riverside town of Columbia, Tennessee.\nUnfortunately for Hood, miscommunication and confusion in the Confederate ranks meant that his trap failed to snap shut. In what became known as the Battle of Spring Hill, Schofield managed withdraw his force to Franklin mostly unscathed. Spring Hill was a catastrophic missed opportunity\u2014half of Schofield\u2019s army passed within earshot of Confederates camped along the road that night without being brought to battle. As his army filed into Franklin Schofield reformed his brigades into an imposing defensive line.\nHood woke up on the 29th \u201cwrathy as a rattlesnake.\u201d The failure at Spring Hill was infuriating\u2014at a council of war that morning he went so far as to accuse the army of cowardice. He ordered a pursuit to Franklin, where he would have one more chance to pulverize Schofield before he reached Nashville.\nBut Franklin did not offer the same possibilities as Spring Hill. Instead of attacking a surrounded and outnumbered enemy, the 20,000 Confederates at Franklin faced a frontal assault over two miles of open ground against a roughly equal foe entrenched behind three lines of breastworks and abatis. Unmoved by his lieutenants\u2019 objections, Hood ordered the assault. The two-mile long butternut line stepped off at 4 P.M.\nThe Confederate advance was immediately torn by scores of Union cannon; Hood had only one battery positioned to counter the enemy fire. Nevertheless, the line swept forward and quickly overlapped and overwhelmed two brigades of George Wagner\u2019s division which had taken up a doubtful position half a mile in front of the main line. Charging and yelling mere yards behind Wagner\u2019s broken men, the Confederates in the center were able to cross the last half mile of their assault largely unopposed by the riflemen behind the breastworks, who were unwilling to shoot their friends amidst their enemies. As a result, the Confederates slammed into the Union center with full momentum and splintered the defenders around the Carter House.\nThousands of men now surged into a deadly vortex of combat with shovels, bayonets, sabers, and pistols in the Carter gardens. The Union line might have broken completely were it not for the quick reaction of brigade commander Emerson Opdycke of Wagner\u2019s division, who had disobeyed orders to join the first exposed line and instead deployed his men about two hundred yards behind the Carter House. He hurled his command forward into the breach and prevented full-scale disaster.\nMeanwhile, Nathan Bedford Forrest managed to force a crossing of the Harpeth River at Hughes\u2019s Ford and threatened to turn the Union left flank. Union cavalry commander James Wilson reacted quickly and sent his horsemen pounding toward the ford to confront their secessionist adversaries. After a brief dismounted firefight, Wilson\u2019s troopers charged, covered by a hail of repeating rifle fire. Although Forrest\u2019s men outnumbered the Federals, they were outgunned by the seven-shot Spencers. They broke and withdrew back across the Harpeth. The battle would have to be decided against the works.\nOn the opposite bank of the river, the butternut soldiers of A.P. Stewart\u2019s corps crashed against the western portion of the main line. Swept by musketry and enfiladed by artillery, the Confederates pressed on until they reached a tall abatis of Osage-orange timber. They had no choice but to try to climb and crack their way through the strong branches under a murderous point-blank fire. Union soldiers would later write about the nightmarish sight of the tangle filled with twisted and contorted corpses. The Confederates retreated, reformed, and renewed the attack as many as six times, but could not dislodge the Union defenders. As the sun set, with his attempt on the right stalled and the hand-to-hand fighting in the center raging into its third hour, Hood sent forward his left wing. The men of Cheatham\u2019s corps, advancing by torchlight, soon became separated and disorganized. When they stumbled within range of the Union works, the rolling stabs of musket flashes felled men by the score. They reached as far as a small locust grove less than fifty yards from the breastworks before they finally withdrew with severe losses, having done little damage to the enemy. The Confederates also fell back in the center, leaving thousands of dead and wounded in the two acres of the Carter gardens. As the pressure lifted, Schofield withdrew his army to Nashville.\nThe Battle of Franklin decimated the Army of Tennessee. Around ten thousand men became casualties on both sides, roughly seven thousand of them Confederates. Fourteen Southern generals became casualties, more than any other battle in the war. Even so, Hood doggedly pursued Schofield with his diminished army to fight again at the Battle of Nashville.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "John M.

Joseph Johnston in Atlanta informing him that he had been relieved. \u00a0Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood--known for his aggressiveness under Lee in the east--took command the following day. \u00a0The message was clear: the Confederates in front of Atlanta needed to take the fight to the enemy.\nHood planned to do just that. \u00a0During the night of July 19-20 he met with his corps commanders to discuss his battle plan: Hardee and Stewart were to assault Thomas at 1:00 p.m. on the 20th, beginning on the right in echelon by division, with \"everything on our side of [Peach Tree Creek] to be taken at all hazards.\" The Confederates were to drive the Yankees west toward the Chattahoochee, where Hood hoped to crush them before Schofield or McPherson, faced by Cheatham and Wheeler, could offer aid.\nThe plan was sound, because the Federal dispositions on the night of the 19th invited attack. While much of Thomas\u2019 army crossed Peach Tree Creek, some troops were still on the north bank, and many of those south of the creek were not yet strongly fortified. Moreover, Schofield\u2019s army, marching toward Decatur, had left a two mile-gap separating it from Thomas. If the Confederates struck hard, with luck they might wreck half of Sherman\u2019s army before the rest of it could respond.\nThings went wrong for Hood, however, on the morning of July 20. Marching west from Decatur toward Atlanta, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan\u2019s Fifteenth Corps made such headway that Hood had to shift his whole line to the right. Hardee\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s corps, drawn up for battle by 1:00 p.m., spent another 90 minutes marching to new positions. By that time the last of Thomas\u2019 army had crossed Peach Tree Creek and had begun digging in on high ground, a half-mile south of the stream.\nHardee, on the right, did not advance until 3:15 or 3:30. His lead division, Bate\u2019s, by chance fell on the gap in the Union lines between Thomas and Schofield. It was never heavily engaged during the day. Maj. Gen. William H. T. Walker\u2019s division, next in line, made first contact with Brig. Gen. John Newton\u2019s division on Thomas\u2019 left. Walker\u2019s men advanced in two lines of battle as the Federals\u2019 opened on them with musketry and cannon fire. The Southerners made repeated charges until about 6:00 p.m. without breaching the enemy works. Hardee\u2019s third division, under General Maney came into action, taking up Walker\u2019s assault. For a while Confederate attackers overlapped Newton\u2019s right flank, but the Federals refused their line to repel the Rebels. All along the line Hardee\u2019s attack had failed.\nLoring\u2019s division of Stewart\u2019s corps took up the attack. Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Featherston\u2019s brigade, on the right, tried repeatedly to make headway, without success. Thomas Scott\u2019s brigade, on Loring\u2019s left, struck the Twentieth Corps line, overrunning the 33rd New Jersey, which had been thrown out in advance of the main line of Geary\u2019s division. Scott then came under heavy fire from Col. Benjamin Harrison\u2019s brigade (Ward\u2019s division) and Geary\u2019s artillery.\nAs Geary\u2019s division repelled Scott on its left, the charge of Maj. Gen. Edward C. Walthall\u2019s Confederate division created a crisis on the other flank. Advancing with three brigades, Walthall\u2019s right brigade, Edward O\u2019Neal\u2019s Alabamans, charged up the ridge along which Collier Road runs and overran Geary\u2019s right. Three regiments of Ohio and Pennsylvania men broke and ran. But the Union line stabilized and O\u2019Neal was pushed back. Walthall\u2019s left brigade, under Brig. Gen. Daniel Reynolds, also drove in skirmishers of Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams\u2019 division and even took a portion of its main lines. Federal counterattacks and enfilading fire forced Walthall back, causing his attack to fall apart. As darkness approached, Stewart ordered his troops back into their trenches.\nBy 6 p.m. the Battle of Peach Tree Creek was over. Hood\u2019s attack had failed.

Better yet, Wheeler reported that as McPherson\u2019s army marched in on Atlanta from the east, it had its left flank \u201cin the air\u201d (Sherman had sent Kenner Garrard\u2019s cavalry east to wreck the Georgia Railroad). This situation presented Hood with an opportunity to launch a flank attack, like the one made famous by Jackson at Chancellorsville. Hood planned for his forces to drop back from their outer lines north of the city into the main fortified perimeter around the city on the night of July 21-22; Stewart and Cheatham would hold the works. Hardee\u2019s corps would march through and out of the city, southeast then northeast toward Decatur, guided by Wheeler\u2019s cavalry and jump into McPherson\u2019s left-rear, while Wheeler attacked McPherson\u2019s wagon trains. It was an ambitious plan, calling for a 15-mile night march by Hardee\u2019s troops and a dawn attack on the 22nd. But a late start, exhaustion of the men, a hot night, dusty roads and poor service from the cavalry combined to bring the four assault divisions not nearly far enough into McPherson\u2019s rear when Hardee, well behind schedule, decided to deploy. Then rough terrain added further delay\u2014Confederate Maj. Gen. W. H. T. Walker was shot and killed getting his division into place. Hardee\u2019s surprise attack did not begin till shortly after noon.\nThe Federals were blessed with a lot of good luck that day. By chance, a Union division under Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Sweeny happened to be in just the right position to meet Hardee\u2019s opening assault. Instead of overrunning hospital tents and wagon trains in McPherson\u2019s rear, Walker\u2019s and Bate\u2019s troops ran instead face-to-face into a division of veteran enemy infantry.\nGeneral McPherson, having left Sherman\u2019s headquarters at the Augustus Hurt house (now Carter Center) just before the firing started, was on this part of the field watching Sweeny contend with the Rebels. Then he rode off to see how Frank Blair\u2019s Seventeenth Corps was doing; by now it had been struck by Cleburne\u2019s hard-hitting division. McPherson and his staff were riding down a wagon road when they unexpectedly ran into part of Cleburne\u2019s line. \u201cHe came upon us suddenly,\u201d remembered Capt. Richard Beard of the 5th Confederate:\n\"I threw up my sword as a signal for him to surrender. He checked his horse, raised his hat in salute, wheeled to the right and dashed off to the rear in a gallop. Corporal Coleman, standing near me, was ordered to fire, and it was his shot that brought General McPherson down.\"\nMcPherson\u2019s subordinates dashed off. One Union officer struck a tree in his flight; the blow smashed his pocket watch and froze the time of the general\u2019s death\u20142:02 p.m. Confederate Captain Beard came up to the body and saw a bullet hole in the back, near the heart. He stayed only long enough to identify the fallen enemy officer as McPherson before continuing his advance. Later, one of McPherson\u2019s staff officers led an ambulance back to the scene, retrieved the general\u2019s corpse, and bore it to Sherman\u2019s headquarters. Sherman was moved with grief for his friend, only the second Union army commander killed during the war.\nCleburne\u2019s attack initially overran part of the Union line, capturing two guns and several hundred prisoners. Then the Southerners ran up against infantry and artillery on a hill occupied by Brig. Gen. Mortimer Leggett\u2019s division, and were stopped. Maney\u2019s Confederate division joined in the fight, but Leggett held onto his hill.\nAround 3:00 p.m. Hood ordered Cheatham\u2019s division to launch an attack from Atlanta\u2019s eastern line of works. Cheatham\u2019s assault against the Federal line held by Logan\u2019s Fifteenth Corps met with initial success, overrunning the Yankee line at the Troup Hurt House and capturing artillery, until a Union counterattack forced it back. Cleburne\u2019s and Maney\u2019s divisions gave up their fight, too, as at the end of the afternoon the Confederates retired to their initial positions. The Battle of Atlanta was ended, save for sporadic artillery and rifle fire into the night. General Logan, named to replace McPherson for the moment, reported 3,722 killed wounded or missing in the Army of the Tennessee. Hardee counted 3,299 casualties in his corps, while Cheatham\u2019s lost probably half that number. Adding in several hundred casualties in Wheeler\u2019s cavalry (from its unsuccessful attack on the Union wagon train at Decatur) Confederate losses on July 22 adds up to about 5,500.

Gen. Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s plan to move swiftly to attack Fort Henry before Confederate reinforcements could arrive.\u00a0 As Grant\u2019s two divisions began their march south, gunboats under the command of Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote proceeded down river to attack the Confederate forts on the Tennessee.\u00a0 In a swift, violent exchange of gunfire, Forts Heiman and Henry quickly fell to the Union gunboats on February 6, 1862.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow consolidated around the two former Confederate forts on the Tennessee River, Grant was determined to move quickly on the much larger Fort Donelson, located on the nearby Cumberland River. Grant\u2019s boast that he would capture Donelson by the 8th of February quickly ran into challenges.\u00a0 Poor winter weather, late-arriving reinforcements, and difficulties in moving the ironclads to the Cumberland, all delayed Grant\u2019s departure for Donelson.\u00a0\nDespite being fairly convinced that no earthen fort could withstand the power of the Union gunboats, Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston allowed the garrison at Fort Donelson to remain and even sent new commanders and reinforcements to the site.\u00a0 On February 11th, Johnston appointed Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd as the commander of Fort Donelson and the surrounding region.\u00a0 17,000 Confederate soldiers, combined with improved artillery positions and earthworks convinced Floyd that a hasty retreat was unnecessary.\nBy February 13th, most of Grant\u2019s Union soldiers had arrived in the vicinity of Fort Donelson and had begun to arrange themselves around the landward side of the fort.\u00a0 Several inches of snowfall and a cold winter wind sent shivers through both armies.\u00a0 With Grant\u2019s reinforced army now blocking a landward exit, the Confederate forces knew that they would have to fight their way to freedom.\n\nOn February 14, 1862, Foote\u2019s ironclads moved upriver to bombard Fort Donelson.\u00a0 The subsequent duel between Foote\u2019s \u201cPook Turtles\u201d and the heavy guns at Fort Donelson led to a Union defeat on the Cumberland.\u00a0 Many of Foote\u2019s ironclads were heavily damaged and Foote himself was wounded in the attack.\u00a0 Grant\u2019s soldiers could hear the Confederate cheers as the Union gunboats retreated.\nWhile Grant was now contemplating an extended siege, the Confederate leaders had devised a bold plan to move all the forces they could to the Union right and to force open a path of escape.\u00a0 Early on the morning of February 15th, the Confederate assault struck the Union right and drove it back from its positions on Dudley\u2019s Hill.\u00a0\u00a0 Brig. Gen. John McClernand\u2019s division attempted to reform their lines, but the ongoing Rebel attacks continued to drive his forces to the southeast.\u00a0 Disaster loomed for the Union army.\n\nBut in what would become one of the oddest and most improbable acts on any Civil War battlefield, Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon Pillow, sensing a complete victory over the Union forces, ordered the attacking force back to their earthworks, thereby abandoning the hard-fought gains of the morning.\u00a0\u00a0\nGrant, who had hurriedly returned to the front, ordered Brig. Gen. Lew Wallace and McClernand to retake their lost ground and then rode to the Union left to order an attack upon the Confederate works opposite Charles Smith\u2019s division.\u00a0 Grant reasoned, correctly, that the Confederate right must be greatly reduced in strength given the heavy Confederate assault on their left.\u00a0 Smith\u2019s division surged up to the works and overwhelmed the one Confederate regiment holding an extended line.\u00a0 Capturing large stretches of the Confederate earthworks, Smith\u2019s division was stopped only by the onset of darkness.\nDuring the night of the 15th and 16th, Confederate leaders discussed their options.\u00a0 Despite many disagreements, it was determined that surrender was the only viable option for the Confederate army. Generals Floyd and Pillow managed to make various excuses and crossed the river to safety.\u00a0 Lt. Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest, disgusted with the Confederate decision to surrender, took his cavalrymen and escaped down the Charlotte Road.\u00a0 Even with these defections, more than 13,000 Confederate soldiers remained at Donelson.\nWith a Union attack poised to strike Fort Donelson, the Federal soldiers were surprised to see white flags flying above the Confederate earthworks.\u00a0 Brig.

With the August temperatures soaring, the Confederates advanced their artillery to engage the Federal line.\u00a0 During the prolonged artillery duel, both Stonewall Jackson and Brig. Gen. Charles Winder participated in firing Confederate artillery pieces.\u00a0 Although it was called \u201cthe prettiest artillery duel ever witnessed during the war,\u201d it had significant consequences when Charles Winder was struck by shell fragments around 5pm and died a few hours later. With few subordinates aware of Jackson\u2019s battle plan, Winder\u2019s loss produced a dangerous leadership vacuum just as a powerful Federal attack was beginning to unfold.\nAt roughly 5:00 p.m., Nathaniel Banks launched two attacks against the Confederate positions.\u00a0 One column of Federal troops moved against Confederate forces near the Cedars while a second force advanced against the Rebel guns placed near the Crittenden Gate - one of the most prominent landmarks on the battlefield.\u00a0 Pressed by the Union advance, the Confederate guns and much of their infantry support pulled back from their positions at the Gate.\u00a0 With defeat in the air, Stonewall Jackson rode into the center of the fighting and attempted to draw his sword that was rusted within its scabbard.

Grant issued orders for the Army of the Potomac to march toward Spotsylvania Court House, a small town along the route to Richmond. He hoped to get between Robert E. Lee's army and Richmond or, at the very least, to draw the Confederates into the open field where he could take advantage of superior Union numbers. It was Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart's job to prevent the Federals from reaching Spotsylvania. For two days, a division of Stuart's cavalry, led by Fitz Lee, had battled Union horsemen for control of the Brock Road, the most direct route between the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House. Forced to relinquish his position near Todd's Tavern, Lee withdrew to a rise of ground known as Laurel Hill on May 8. Laurel Hill was the last defensible position this side of Spotsylvania. If the Confederates lost Laurel Hill, they would also lose Spotsylvania.\u00a0\nFortunately for Stuart and Fitz Lee, help was near at hand. General Richard Anderson, now in command of James Longstreet's First Corps, had marched for Spotsylvania during the night, and by the morning of May 8, his troops were within two miles of Laurel Hill. Anderson's corps had just gone into bivouac near the Po River when one of Stuart's couriers arrived warning him of the Union army's approach. The new corps commanders instantly put his troops back on the road and let them toward Laurel Hill.\u00a0\nBelieving Spotsylvania to be within his grasp, Union Maj. Gen. Gouveneur K. Warren advanced his Fifth Corps up Laurel where they were surprised to find Maj. Gen. Richard Anderson and the men of Longstreet's corps opposing them. Warren's attempts to drive the Confederates were rebuffed with heavy losses and the two sides began to entrench. During this time, Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick, commander of the Union Sixth Corps, was shot dead, becoming the highest ranking Union officer killed during the war.\u00a0\nGrant tried to break the deadlock and Spotsylvania over the next two days. On May 9, Grant sent a portion of Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's Second Corps across the Po River in an effort to find Lee's left flank. Spying Hancock's move, Lee shifted two divisions to counter the Federals at Block House Bridge, forcing the Yankees back across the river. Grant spent the next day probing Lee's line for weaknesses and nearly found one when a young colonel named Emory Upton briefly breached the Confederate line with a tightly packed, fast-moving column of regiments. Though Upton's assault was indecisive, it gave Grant an idea.\u00a0\nBy May 12, the Confederates had established a long line of earthworks, which included a huge half-mile bulge in the Confederate line called the Muleshoe Salient. Basing his plan off of Upton's attack, Grant massed 20,000 men of the Second Corps opposite the tip of the Muleshoe. Lee noted the Federal movement, but mistakenly believing Grant that was preparing to withdraw, removed his artillery from the salient. Thus, when Hancock's men advanced on the morning of May 12, they broke through the Confederate line that was without artillery. After the initial breakthrough, however, Lee shifted reinforcements into the salient just as Grant hurled more troops at the Confederate works. Fighting devolved into a point-blank slugfest\u2014amid a torrential downpour\u2014which lasted for 22 hours and claimed roughly 17,000 lives.\u00a0\nThe stubborn stand by Confederate troops at the Bloody Angle gave Lee the time he needed to construct a new line of earthworks across the base of the Muleshoe Salient. The Army of the Potomac, exhausted from its attacks on the Angle, did not test the new line\u2014at least, not right away. Instead, Grant slid his army to the left. When Union troops finally moved forward toward this position early on May 18, they were met by the massed artillery fire and easily repulsed. Stymied but undaunted, Grant called off the attack and resumed shifting his troops to the left.

At early dawn, Union cavalry splashed across Germanna Ford, dispersing Confederate cavalry pickets there and enabling Union engineers to construct two pontoon bridges. General Gouverneur Warren\u2019s Fifth Corps thumped across the ford at 6 a.m., entering a dense, forbidding woodland known as the Wilderness. Meade intended to push through the Wilderness, wheel his army to the right, and attack Lee\u2019s army, which he assumed would take up a defensive position behind Mine Run several miles to the west. Confident that Federal cavalry was between him and Confederate army, Warren ordered his men to bivouac near Wilderness Tavern.\nThe following morning Warren resumed his march. No sooner had he started, however, than a courier dashed up with news that Confederate infantry was approaching on the Turnpike. Believing that Lee would fight a defensive battle behind Mine Run, General George Meade ordered Warren to strike the Confederates. The Fifth Corps chief, however, was apprehensive about making an attack in the Wilderness, where dense thickets would make it all but impossible to maintain a battle line and nullify the Federals\u2019 numerical superiority. Warren\u2019s protests notwithstanding, the Fifth Corps advanced astride the Orange Turnpike.\nWhile Warren and Meade debated the merits of an attack along the Orange Turnpike, General Richard Stoddert Ewell\u2019s Confederate corps built strong earthworks west of Saunders Field. When Warren\u2019s men stepped out of the woods and into the open, Ewell\u2019s troops exacted a fearful toll in casualties. The Yankees achieved a momentary breakthrough, but swift action by General John B. Gordon\u2019s brigade sealed the breach. The arrival of the Union Sixth Corps did little more than broaden the front and lengthen the list of casualties.\nShortly after Warren spotted Confederates on the Orange Turnpike, Union General Samuel Crawford, at the Chewning farm, observed another enemy column headed up the Orange Plank Road toward its intersection with the Brock Road. This was a serious threat: if the Confederates gained possession of this point, they could drive a wedge between Warren\u2019s corps, on the Turnpike to your right, and General Winfield S. Hancock\u2019s corps, to the south. Meade quickly dispatched General George W. Getty\u2019s Sixth Corps division to seize the crossroads. Around 4 pm, Getty attacked, his men tearing through the dense thickets in a vicious close-range fight with General A.P. Hill\u2019s corps. Hancock soon arrived and rushed forward to support Getty, continuing the fight until nightfall\u2014and exhaustion\u2014ended the fighting.\nThe Federals resumed the offensive the following morning. A.P. Hill\u2019s exhausted troops were forced back and the Confederates seemed on the verge of collapse until the Texas Brigade of Longstreet\u2019s corps arrived, and staved off disaster. A pair of flank attacks\u2014made by Longstreet on the southern portion of the field and by Gordon to the north\u2014helped break the stalemate, forcing the Federals behind breastworks. However, just as Longstreet\u2019s men were on the brink of success, Lee\u2019s Old Warhorse was felled by an errant volley from his own troops. Lee himself had to organize for the final push against the Yankees along the Brock Road\u2014a time-consuming effort in the Wilderness. The ensuing lull allowed Hancock the chance to rally his men and supervise the construction of earthworks.\nLee\u2019s final assault turned out to be a colossal failure. Hampered by the heavy brush, the Confederates stumbled forward without cohesion until they reached obstructions in front of the Union line. There they were stopped cold by the crashing volleys from Hancock\u2019s veterans. In one spot, Confederate troops dashed forward and planted their flags on the burning works. But their success was short-lived. Within minutes, Union troops counterattacked and reclaimed the works.\nOn May 7, both sides dug in and awaited attack. Realizing that he could make no further headway in the Wilderness, Grant ordered Meade\u2019s army to pull out of the works after dark and head for Spotsylvania Court House. He had suffered some 20,000 casualties in the Wilderness, nearly twice as many as Lee, but his troops were not dispirited.

Popular fervor led President Lincoln to push a cautious Brigadier General Irvin McDowell, commander of the Union army\u00a0in Northern Virginia,\u00a0to attack the Confederate forces commanded by Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard, which held a relatively strong position along Bull Run, just northeast of Manassas Junction. The goal was to make quick work of the bulk of the Confederate army, open the way to Richmond, the Confederate capital, and end the war.\nThe morning of July 21st dawned on two generals planning to outflank their opponent\u2019s left. Hindering the success of the Confederate plan were several communication failures and general lack of coordination between units. McDowell\u2019s forces, on the other had, were hampered by an overly complicated plan that required complex synchronization.\u00a0 Constant and repeated delays on the march and effective scouting by the Confederates gave his movements away, and, worst of all Patterson failed to occupy Johnston\u2019s Confederate forces attention in the west.\u00a0 McDowell\u2019s forces began by shelling the Confederates across Bull Run.\u00a0 Others crossed at Sudley Ford and slowly made their way to attack the Confederate left flank. At the same time as Beauregard sent small detachments to handle what he thought was only a distraction, he also sent a larger contingent to execute flanking a flanking movement of his own on the Union left.\nFighting raged throughout the day as Confederate forces were driven back, despite impressive efforts by Colonel Thomas Jackson to hold important high ground at Henry House Hill, earning him the nom de guerre \u201cStonewall.\u201d Late in the afternoon, Confederate reinforcements including those arriving by rail from the Shenandoah Valley extended the Confederate line and succeeded in breaking the Union right flank.

The calamitous retreat was further impeded by the hordes of fleeing onlookers who had come down from Washington to enjoy the spectacle. Although victorious, Confederate forces were too disorganized to pursue. By July 22, the shattered Union army reached the safety of Washington. The Battle of Bull Run convinced the Lincoln administration and the North that the Civil War would be a long and costly affair. McDowell was relieved of command of the Union army and replaced by Maj.

Major Walker of the 11th Vermont later recounted: \u201c[Sheridan\u2019s men were inspired\u00a0 that he was] at the very front and under fire of the enemy\u2026carefully attending to details which we had been accustomed to see more celebrated commanders entrust to their staff.\u201d Union soldiers pierced the Confederate lines but strong artillery fire and a determined counterattack drove the Northerners back across the \u201cMiddle Field\u201d\u2014now the bloodiest ground in the Shenandoah Valley. Union Sixth Corps veterans in reserve blunted the Confederate counterattack. Among those pushing back was Union Colonel Ranald Mackenzie who galloped into battle under fire with a grin on his face, \u201cthe men hated him with the hate of hell, but they could not draw a bead on so brave a man as that.\u201dLater that afternoon, Sheridan unleashed his Eighth Corps and powerful cavalry forces upon the Confederate left flank. Major Walker witnessed Sheridan ride \u201calong the whole of our extended skirmish line, wheeling out from the storm of bullets only as he reached our own division, and pausing as he passed between the brigades to exclaim, \u2018Crook and Averell are on their left and rear\u2014we\u2019ve got\u2019em bagged, by God!\u2019\u201d Early scrambled to maintain position but was steadily forced backward. By early evening, Early was falling back through Winchester southward towards Fisher\u2019s Hill. Early never counted this as a defeat in his book, years later exclaiming, \u201cSheridan ought to have been cashiered \u201cfor letting us escape with more than half our men.\" Third Winchester was the bloodiest battle of the Shenandoah Valley, resulting in more casualties than the entire 1862 Valley campaign.

George B. McClellan to withdraw from the outskirts of Richmond to Harrison\u2019s Landing on the lower James River, Gen. Robert E. Lee turned his attention to the threat posed by the newly formed Union Army of Virginia, under the command of Gen. John Pope.\u00a0 The Lincoln administration had chosen Pope to lead the reorganized forces in northern Virginia with the dual task of shielding Washington and operating northwest of Richmond to take pressure off McClellan\u2019s army.\u00a0 To counter Pope\u2019s movement into central Virginia, Lee sent Gen. T. J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson to Gordonsville on July 13.\u00a0 Jackson\u2019s force crossed the Rapidan River and clashed with the vanguard of Pope\u2019s army at Cedar Mountain, south of Culpeper, on August 9. \u00a0Jackson\u2019s narrow tactical victory proved sufficient to instill caution in the Union high command. \u00a0\u00a0The initiative shifted to Lee.\nConfirming that McClellan\u2019s Army of the Potomac was departing the Virginia Peninsula southeast of Richmond to join forces with Pope in northern Virginia, Lee ordered James Longstreet\u2019s wing of the Army of Northern Virginia to join Jackson.\u00a0 After providing for Richmond\u2019s defense, Lee arrived at Gordonsville on August 15.\u00a0 \u00a0Lee intended to destroy Pope before the bulk of McClellan\u2019s reinforcements could arrive and bring overwhelming numbers to bear against the Confederates.\u00a0 However, Pope foiled Lee\u2019s plans by withdrawing behind the Rappahannock on August 19.\nTo draw Pope away from his defensive positions along the Rappahannock, Lee made a daring move.\u00a0 On August 25 he sent Jackson on a sweeping flank march around the Union right to gain its rear and sever Pope\u2019s supply line.\u00a0 At sunset on August 26, Jackson\u2019s forces completed a remarkable 55-mile march, striking the Orange and Alexandria Railroad at Bristoe Station and subsequently capturing Pope\u2019s supply depot at Manassas Junction overnight.\u00a0 As expected, Pope abandoned the Rappahannock line to pursue Jackson, while Lee circled around to bring up Longstreet\u2019s half of the Confederate army.\u00a0 After fending off the advance of Pope\u2019s army near Bristoe, Jackson torched the remaining Union supplies at Manassas and slipped away, taking up a position north of Groveton, near the old Bull Run battlefield.\nAlerted that Lee had reached Thoroughfare Gap and would arrive the following day, Jackson struck a lone Union division on the Warrenton Turnpike, resulting in a fierce engagement at the Brawner Farm on the evening of August 28.\u00a0 Believing that Jackson was attempting to escape, Pope directed his scattered forces to converge on the Confederate position.\u00a0 Throughout the day on August 29, Union forces made piecemeal attacks on Jackson\u2019s line, positioned along an unfinished railroad, while Pope awaited a flanking movement by Fitz John Porter\u2019s command.\u00a0 Although the Union assaults pierced Jackson\u2019s line on several occasions, the attackers were repulsed each time.\u00a0 Late in the morning, Lee arrived on the field with Longstreet\u2019s command taking position on Jackson\u2019s right and blocking Porter\u2019s advance.\u00a0 Lee hoped to unleash Longstreet on the vulnerable Union left, but Longstreet convinced the Confederate commander that circumstances did not favor an attack.\nAugust 30 dawned on a morning of indecision, as Pope confronted conflicting intelligence and weighed his options.\u00a0 Convinced that the Confederates were retreating, the Union commander ordered a pursuit near midday, but the advance quickly ended when skirmishers encountered Jackson\u2019s forces still ensconced behind the unfinished railroad.\u00a0 Pope\u2019s plans now shifted to a major assault on Jackson\u2019s line.\u00a0 Porter\u2019s corps and John Hatch\u2019s division attacked Jackson\u2019s right at the \u201cDeep Cut,\u201d an excavated section of the railroad grade.\u00a0 However, with ample artillery support, the Confederate defenders repulsed the attack.\nLee and Longstreet seized the initiative and launched a massive counterattack against the Union left.\u00a0 Longstreet\u2019s wing, nearly 30,000 strong, swept eastward toward Henry Hill, where the Confederates hoped to cut off Pope\u2019s escape.\u00a0 Union forces mounted a tenacious defense on Chinn Ridge which bought time for Pope to shift enough troops onto Henry Hill and stave off disaster. \u00a0The Union lines on Henry Hill held as the Confederate counterattack stalled before dusk.\u00a0 After dark, Pope pulled his beaten army off the field and across Bull Run.\u00a0 A final Confederate effort to flank Pope resulted in a bloody fight at Chantilly (Ox Hill) on September 1, hastening the Union retreat toward the Washington defenses.\u00a0 With Union forces in disarray, Lee grasped the opportunity to lead his army across the Potomac into Maryland for its first incursion into the North.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "John Pope", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/john-pope-1.html"}], "name": "Second Manassas", "confederate_killed": "1305", "battle_dates": "August 28 - 30, 1862", "total_strength": "125,000", "confederate_strength": "5", "result": "Confederate Victory", "union_wounded": "8215", "union_missing": "3893", "alternate_names": "Second Bull Run, Groveton, Brawner's Farm", "confederate_commanders": [{"name": "Robert E.

Gen. Jubal Early withdrew to the Shenandoah Valley to regroup. President Abraham Lincoln had ordered an immediate pursuit of the Confederates in hopes of seizing an opportunity to crush Early\u2019s command while it was separated from General Robert E. Lee\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia, which at the time was struggling against General Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s armies in the trenches around Petersburg and Richmond.\nThe pursuit of Early\u2019s army was led by Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright, commanding the Union Sixth Corps and elements of the Nineteenth Corps. Wright was soon joined by a portion of the Eighth Corps, under Brig. Gen. George Crook. This column of approximately 10,500 men was to pursue Early until it was certain that he was returning to the Richmond and Petersburg front.\nOn July 17, Early\u2019s command entered the Shenandoah Valley. Early established his headquarters in Berryville Virginia, and left Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon\u2019s division to guard Snicker\u2019s Ford on the Shenandoah River. Union cavalry followed Early and seized Snicker\u2019s Gap, making several attempts to cross at Snickers Ford, also known as Castleman\u2019s Ferry, but were repulsed by Gordon\u2019s men.\nGrowing uneasy about the increasing Union presence at Snicker\u2019s Ford and determined to resist any further pursuit the next day, Early moved Maj. Gen. Robert Rodes\u2019 and Brig. Gen. Gabriel Wharton\u2019s divisions within supporting distance of Gordon.\nUnion general Wright believed that Snickers Ford was held only by a strong rearguard and decided to attack. On July 18, Wright ordered the 3,250-man division under Col. Joseph Thoburn of Crook\u2019s Eighth Corps to cross at Island Ford, one mile north of Gordon\u2019s position. While Wright kept the Confederates focused on Snickers Ford, at 3pm Thoburn moved under cover of the hills and trees to Island Ford and intended to swing south to take Gordon\u2019s division in the flank and rear.\nFrom prisoners captured in crossing at Island Ford, Thoburn learned he was not facing a determined rear guard, but in fact the bulk of Early\u2019s command. Word was immediately sent back to Wright regarding these developments while Thoburn continued to push his command across the ford and deploy his artillery on the heights to the east.\nThoburn was ordered to await reinforcements from the Sixth Corps before proceeding further and deployed his division in two lines of battle on the flood plains west of the Shenandoah River. The first line was advanced 100 yards from the river into a wheatfield, while the second line took cover behind a low stone wall near the river.\nAs news of the Union crossing reached Early in Berryville, Rodes\u2019 and Wharton\u2019s divisions were sent to support Gordon. Wharton\u2019s command was moved directly towards Island Ford, Rodes Division advanced past Cool Spring farm forming on Wharton\u2019s left.\nRodes attacked Thoburn\u2019s right and heavy fighting erupted for possession of a stone wall that bisected the wheat field. Wharton joined the attack and began to exact a heavy toll on Thoburn\u2019s men, forcing them to fall back in disorder to the protection of the second stone wall near the river. A final desperate attempt was made by the Confederates to dislodge Thoburn, but they were severely cut up by the hail of artillery fire from the bluffs on the east side of the Shenandoah River. Stiffening Union resistance at the second wall, coupled with deadly artillery support, forced the Confederate divisions to pull back beyond the ridge line in the Union front. Although reinforcements from the Sixth Corps arrived on the east bank of the river, Wright realized the futility of further escalation and ordered Thoburn to fall back across the river during the night. Some 400 men on each side were killed, wounded or captured.\nBoth forces cautiously watched each other throughout the next day. On July 19,Maj. Gen. David Hunter broke the stalemate, sending a force from Harpers Ferry to pressure Early's position from the north by moving into Martinsburg, WV.

His monumental triumphs at Front Royal and Winchester, on May 23 and 25, had unhinged Unionist aspirations for control of the Valley, but now fresh Northern forces under John C. Fremont and James Shields pursued him in quest of revenge.\nThe towering, generally impassable, Massanutten massif played a key role in setting the stage, separating the Valley into two discrete halves for fifty miles.  So did the two arms of the Shenandoah River, wending northward on either side of the big mountain, and only bridged infrequently.\u00a0 The disparate Federal commands allowed themselves to be separated by the Valley's topography.\u00a0 Shields moved through the smaller valley east of Massanutten; Fremont followed Jackson west of the mountain, and in direct contact.\n Keeping Fremont and his troops from following close behind became an essential element for Jackson's success.  If they arrived around Port Republic--south of the Massanutten--in time to collaborate with Shields, Jackson faced dire odds and the potential to be assailed from both sides.\nOn Sunday, June 8, Stonewall prepared for the church services he so much loved as quiet early morning light bathed his headquarters at the southern edge of Port Republic.  Shields had not yet shown up from due north, and Confederate General Richard S. Ewell stood athwart Fremont's path at Cross Keys, a few miles from Port, down the Harrisonburg Road.\nDick Ewell's troops occupied an admirable defensive line above Mill Creek, in a region known as \"Cross Keys\" because of a nearby wayside tavern of that name.  The Confederate line followed commanding ground, conveniently high enough above the stream to afford a magnificent field of fire onto any approaching foe.  As though sculpted by nature for this military purpose, the high ground curled at its outer ends into a bit of an arc.  An attacking enemy would expose his flanks to the edges of that crescent.\nUnwilling to await an attack, and eager to close with the Yankees, General Isaac Ridgeway Trimble pushed his brigade of four regiments forward from the right (east) end of the Mill Creek line.\u00a0 Trimble's men\u2014one regiment each from Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and North Carolina--found cover behind a fencerow, in a perfect position to ambush any Federals who pushed forward without appropriate caution.  Enough vegetation grew around the fence to provide useful camouflage.\nPrecisely such an incautious advance as Trimble anticipated walked aimlessly into the Confederate deadfall, and paid a ghastly price for the error when Julius Stahel's brigade of New York a Pennsylvania troops moved toward Trimble's covert position, where they were gunned down at close range. Trimble's men, riding the crest of a wave of momentum generated by their repulse of the Stahel, pushed their advance right through the point where the Federal attack began.\nWith Fremont violently overwhelmed at a crucial point, and stymied everywhere else, Ewell had deftly accomplished his mission.  Jackson would have the morning of June 9 in which to defeat the Federal force approaching Port Republic under Shields, without interference from the direction of Cross Keys.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "John C.

Robert E. Lee opened the Maryland Campaign in an attempt to draw the Army of the Potomac out of war-worn Virginia. Expecting the historic arsenal at Harpers Ferry to evacuate when the Army of Northern Virginia marched up the Shenandoah Valley, Lee hoped to requisition the garrison\u2019s supplies and open a supply line back into Virginia. Knowing that the Army of the Potomac was in pursuit, Lee ordered a bold maneuver.\u00a0 On September 9 he issued Special Order 191, an audacious plan that involved splitting his army in three and sending three divisions led by Gen. Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson to seize Harpers Ferry.\nOn September 7, the U.S. War Department received word that Lee had left Frederick, Maryland, yet Jackson\u2019s division had disappeared. The next day, the Union commander at Harpers Ferry, Col. Dixon S. Miles, famous for his drunkenness during the Battle of Bull Run, began preparations to defend Harpers Ferry. The topographical features of the town, however, rendered it nearly indefensible.\u00a0 Surrounded by three heights, the successful defense of Harper\u2019s Ferry relied on holding Bolivar Heights, Maryland Heights, and 1,200-foot Loudoun Heights.\u00a0 Disregarding the advice of his subordinates, Miles divided his 12,000 men into four brigades, with the main force tasked with defending Bolivar Heights, a ridge two miles west of town on the southern bank of the Potomac.\u00a0 Miles posted a lone brigade atop Maryland Heights and a brigade of militia on Camp Hill. While he posted troops on Bolivar and Maryland Heights, he ignored Loudoun Heights, convinced that the oncoming Confederates would be unwilling or unable to secure artillery on the steep rise.\u00a0 On the highly strategic Maryland Heights, Miles deployed his weakest brigade that contained several troops that had never seen battle. On Camp Hill, a gentle slope above the town placed in an ideal defensive position, Miles posted a brigade of mostly untrained militia. The majority of his soldiers, Miles kept posted near the town.\nJackson\u2019s division left Frederick in Sept. 10, and fighting began on September 12 on Maryland Heights. Jackson coordinated an attack that began with Gen. Lafayette McLaws placing artillery on Maryland Heights, aimed for an attack against both Bolivar Heights and Camp Hill. The troops defending Maryland Heights - Col. Thomas H. Ford\u2019s 126th New York Volunteers - had only been in the army for 21 days and were no match for the seasoned veterans of Joseph B. Kershaw\u2019s and William Barksdale\u2019s brigades.\u00a0 At 9 a.m. on September 13 they advanced up the steep slopes of Maryland Heights and swept away the New Yorkers, who fled instantly.

Hill\u2019s Division advanced toward the Federals on Bolivar Heights, meeting stiff resistance from Col. Stephen Downey\u2019s 3rd Maryland Brigade. Undeterred, the Confederates nudged Downey back towards Camp Hill.\u00a0 With the three major heights surrounding Harper\u2019s Ferry now firmly in his possession, Jackson ordered additional artillery to be brought up that evening in preparation for a fierce strike on the morning of the 15th.\nDuring the night, Jackson brought up five batteries from Hill\u2019s division and placed them on Maryland Heights and around the base of Loudoun Heights. Coordinating one fierce strike, Jackson ordered an infantry assault for 8 a.m. the next morning, sending A.P. Hill forward as his batteries enfiladed the Union left. As guns began firing from the two batteries placed on the Union right, most of Miles\u2019s infantry took shelter in ravines and tranches. As Jackson ordered Hill\u2019s guns to cease firing, he ordered the infantry to storm the Federal works.\u00a0 Union artillery was rapidly losing ammunition.\u00a0 Believing the situation to be hopeless, Miles called a council in a nearby home that unanimously decided further resistance was useless.\u00a0 As the surrender was debated, a shell burst through the wall, fatally wounding Miles and shattering his left leg. The garrison surrendered, giving the surrender at Harpers Ferry the distinction of leading to the capture of the most prisoners of any battle throughout the war.\nJackson sent a courier to Lee telling him of the victory, and received in reply a message to get his men to Sharpsburg as quickly as possible.\u00a0 Jackson left Hill to accept the surrender of Harpers Ferry, who then paroled 12,000 prisoners, captured 73 pieces of artillery, 13,000 arms, and large quantities of wagons and supplies.

A portion of those forces were under the command of General Frederick Steele. Steele\u2019s, in an operation that would become known as the Camden Expedition, would support Banks by advancing on Shreveport from the North. In March, Steele set out from Little Rock, Arkansas, and reached the Little Missouri River on April 3. Steele chose to cross at Elkin's Ferry.

Grant sent Major General Phillip Sheridan on an ambitious cavalry raid toward Charlottesville. Sheridan hoped to destroy as much of the Virginia Central railroad as possible, interrupting crucial Confederate supply lines, and then press on and join forces with General David Hunter in Charlottesville.\nWhen Robert E. Lee became aware of this Union movement, he sent the cavalry divisions of General Wade Hampton and General Fitzhugh Lee to attack the Federals near Trevilian Station, Virginia. What resulted was the largest and bloodiest all-cavalry battle of the Civil War. On June 11, the two divisions approached the Union position along separate roads, with Hampton\u2019s men coming from Trevilian Station and Lee\u2019s men from nearby Louisa Court House. Hampton\u2019s division clashed with the Union First Division under Brigadier General Alfred Torbert, and vicious dismounted fighting raged while Hampton waited for Fitzhugh Lee\u2019s division to arrive and provide support. However, when Lee\u2019s force encountered Union General George Custer\u2019s men on the road, they fell back after only a brief fight, a dangerous decision that created an opening for Custer to take Hampton\u2019s supply train.\nCuster\u2019s men immediately took advantage of this gap, driving a wedge between the two Confederate divisions and capturing essential supplies. However, in their haste to claim the spoils of their momentary victory, Custer\u2019s cavalry allowed themselves to be cut off from the rest of Sheridan\u2019s force. When Confederate reinforcements arrived, they were quickly surrounded. This clash has become known as \u201cCuster\u2019s First Last Stand.\u201d The four Michigan regiments of Custer\u2019s brigade took fire from all sides, and only Sheridan\u2019s arrival to drive back the Confederate force saved the Boy General and his men from capture or death. By the time night fell on the 11th, Union forces held Trevilian Station.\nThe next morning, June 12, Sheridan\u2019s men tore up several miles of railroad before advancing on Hampton\u2019s position to the west. Hampton\u2019s men had spent the night establishing a strong position, with an angled line anchored on the railroad embankment and, by midday, support from Fitzhugh Lee. Time and time again Sheridan ordered his cavalry to attack this line, and time and time again they were driven back. The men began to refer to the angle in Hampton\u2019s line as their own \u201cBloody Angle,\u201d referencing the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House the month before. Ultimately, Sheridan was forced to abandon his attempts to break Hampton\u2019s line, and he withdrew that night, returning to the Army of the Potomac.\nWhile Sheridan and other Union commanders tried to claim the Battle of Trevilian Station as a victory, most historians describe the battle as either inconclusive or a Confederate victory. Sheridan did succeed in drawing Confederate attention away from General Grant\u2019s movements near the James River, but he failed at to meet up with General Hunter or create any real, long-term disruption of the Confederate supply line. Furthermore, the casualties sustained in this battle and the month-long separation of the cavalry from the rest of the Army of the Potomac had a serious impact on the army\u2019s operations during one of the toughest campaigns of the war.

In order to ensure the success of his scheme, Lee planned to employ every unit in his army except the division of Theophilus Holmes and J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry.\nGeorge B. McClellan would not be sharing in his army's struggles this day. On the morning of June 30, the Young Napoleon boarded the Union gunboat Galena and spent the rest of the day completely cutoff from all communications with his beleaguered army. He left behind a leaderless force that occupied a patchwork defensive position stretching from White Oak Swamp to Malvern Hill on the James River. Without McClellan there to direct them, each corps and division commander posted his troops and fought the battle, in the words of one corps commander, \"according to his own ideas.\"\nIn what was becoming a sadly recurring theme of the campaign, poor communication, confusion, and lackluster performances among the Confederate generals once again threatened to sap Lee's attack of all its energy. Two divisions of Union infantry and six batteries under the temporary command of William Franklin guarded the army's northern flank along White Oak Swamp, preventing a sluggish and cautious Stonewall Jackson from materially contributing to the day's action. At the same time, Benjamin Huger's Confederate division wasted hours cutting a new road through the thick woods and never participated in the battle.\nShortly after 4:00pm an impatient Lee ordered James Longstreet's and A.

Angles in the Confederate works allowed Lee\u2019s men to easily enfilade the Federal ranks as they advanced.\u00a0 An estimated 7,000 men were killed or wounded within the first thirty minutes of the assault and the massacre continued through the morning. In Hancock\u2019s sector, elements of the Second Corps managed to seize a portion of the Rebel works only to be bombarded by Confederate artillery that turned the trenches a deathtrap. Smith\u2019s Corps was unfavorably funneled into two ravines and subsequently mowed down when they reached the Confederate\u2019s position. \u00a0Pinned down by the tremendous volume of Confederate fire, the remaining Federals dug trenches of their own, sometimes including bodies of dead comrades as part of their improvised earthworks. At 12:30 pm, after riding the beleaguered Union lines himself, Grant suspended his attack.\nFrom June 4 to June 12, the days were filled with minor attacks, artillery duels, and sniping. On June 7, Lee and Grant a two-hour truce to allow the Federals a chance to retrieve their wounded. However, by then few of the wounded were found alive as thousands had died under the summer sun during those five days. Grant later wrote, \"I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made... No advantage whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we sustained.\"\nHis regrets notwithstanding, Grant planned his next move.\u00a0 He sent Sheridan to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad to the west and on June 12 ordered Meade to evacuate Cold Harbor, cross the James, and proceed toward Petersburg.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "George G.

The brakeman and the baggage-master were escorted by Union soldiers into the presence of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. When questioned, they informed the Union commander that the Confederate army defending Vicksburg, which they estimated numbered 25,000 men with ten batteries, was in Edwards and preparing to attack the rear of Grant\u2019s army. This was not a bad estimate of the Confederate army, which actually consisted of 23,000 men and 15 batteries. Grant ordered his troops, 32,000 in all, to march on Edwards along three parallel roads\u2014one upper, one lower, and one midway between them.\nAlthough the opening shots of the Battle of Champion Hill were fired along the lower road around 7 A.M., it was not until 9:45 that the vanguard of Brig. Gen. Alvin Hovey\u2019s division turned a bend in the upper road and reached the country home of Sid and Matilda Champion. A half-mile southwest of the house was the bald crest of Champion Hill, which dominated a strategic crossroads that would be vital to the final assault on Vicksburg.\nOn top of the hill Hovey could see soldiers clad in butternut and gray supported by artillery. These guns opened fire on the long blue column and announced that battle had been joined.\nHovey quickly swung his men into line of battle, supported by the men of John A. Logan\u2019s division. Grant arrived on the field shortly after 10 A.M. and ordered this powerful battle line to advance. With a mighty cheer the Federals slammed into the Confederates at the base of the hill and a wild hand-to-hand brawl ensued.\nUnion soldiers swept over the crest of Champion Hill and drove hard toward the crossroads only 600 yards farther south. Despite a murderous fire of musketry and artillery, Hovey\u2019s division seized the crossroads and the Union army was on the verge of victory.\nConfederate general John Pemberton ordered a desperate counterattack by John Bowen\u2019s Division. Around 2 p.m., with the \u201cRebel Yell\u201d ringing in the air, Bowen\u2019s Missourians and Arkansans slammed into Hovey\u2019s men before they could consolidate their hold on the crossroads. Bowen\u2019s rugged soldiers surged over the crest of Champion Hill and pushed the enemy back to the Champion House. Their success, however, was short-lived, as two more Union divisions charged the hill. Threatened in flank and rear, Bowen was compelled to fall back. When the Federals again seized the crossroads, victory was theirs.\nBrig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman\u2019s brigade was left behind to cover the Confederate retreat. The Federals advanced in force against Tilghman and he was mortally wounded while directing the fire of Capt. James Cowen\u2019s Mississippi battery. His brigade was forced from the field, but his sacrifice enabled most of Pemberton\u2019s army to safely withdraw towards Vicksburg, with the exception of Loring\u2019s Division, which was cut off and managed to escape southeastward to Crystal Springs.

Sherman began his Atlanta Campaign in May of 1864, clashing with Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee as it withdrew towards Atlanta in the face of Sherman's successive flanking maneuvers. During the month of June, several battles were fought around Marietta, Georgia, including Pine Mountain and Kolb's Farm led Johnston to establish a seven mile long, formidably entrenched, arc shaped line beginning at Kennesaw Mountain and Little Kennesaw Mountain, a mere fifteen miles outside of Atlanta. With the roads in this vicinity all but impassable, Sherman could no longer flank his enemy. Frustrated, Sherman considered a course of action he had previously refused to enact: attack the enemy\u2019s fortifications head-on. On June 24, he drew up an order for an assault on the 27th\u00a0which called for Maj. Gen. James McPherson, whose army held the Union left near the Kennesaw Mountain, and Maj. Gen. George Thomas, who held the center, to select points of attack to break the enemy line while Gen. John Schofield maneuvered on the right to draw out Johnston\u2019s line.\u00a0\nAt 8:00 a.m. on June 27, over fifty cannons on McPherson's front opened fire on Kennesaw Mountain. Troops of the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps started skirmishing in the dense undergrowth to prevent the Rebels from shifting forces to Little Kennesaw and Pigeon Hill. Three brigades under Maj. Gen. John A Logan's Fifteenth Corps moved forward, but despite overrunning some of the rifle pits fronting them and capturing a number of Rebels, they could not get within fifteen yards of the principal Confederate defenses. Most Federals became mired in the undergrowth and punishing musketry as they attempted to ascend the slope. Well-directed fire by Maj. Gen. Samuel French's artillery on Little Kennesaw and a Confederate counterattack eventually drove off the Yankees.\u00a0\nAt the center of the Union line, the two armies were only 400 yards apart. Thomas chose portions of the Fourth and Fourteenth Corps to make the attack against the Rebels. Facing them was Confederate Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's division, which had built abatis, driven sharp wooden stakes in the ground and strengthened its entrenchments with headlogs and Brig. Gen. George Maney's Tennessee brigade (under Maj. Gen. Frank Cheatham) whose position jutted forth in an inverted V salient on a rise now known as Cheatham's Hill. Federal artillery opened at 8:00 a.m., shelling the Rebel works for a quarter hour before advancing an hour later under heavy fire, stalling at the abatis around 45 yards from the enemy works. Some Federals got close to the enemy works. Union Colonel Daniel McCook, Jr. stood at the Rebel parapet urging his men on when he was shot in the chest. Reacting quickly, Col. Oscar Harmon of the One Hundred and Twenty Fifth Illinois took command of the brigade, but he was shot five minutes later, mortally wounded.\u00a0 On McCook's left, Brig. Gen. Charles Harker urged his men forward astride his white horse, before being mortally struck in the arm and chest. After 10:00 a.m., the Union attack became disorganized and the men fell back.\u00a0 Some men of Col. John Mitchell's brigade made it up the slope to one of Maney's entrenched salients where the lines became so close that the Tennesseans threw rocks at the advancing Federals. Eventually Mitchell's men had to retreat and find cover anywhere from twenty to a hundred yards from the Confederate works and dig in with their bayonets at what was later called the \"Dead Angle.\"\u00a0\nBy 11:30 that morning, the Union attack had failed. The frontal assault cost Sherman 3,000 men in just over three hours. Although the survivors of the assaulting columns at Cheatham Hill spent the next five days in advanced works only thirty yards from the Confederate position, there was no more heavy fighting at Kennesaw.

Johnston ordered Brig. Gen. James Cantey\u2019s small infantry brigade to Resaca, a small town along the Western & Atlantic on the north bank of the Oostanaula River, five and a half miles to the east of Snake Creek Gap. After digging earthworks to guard the railroad and wagon bridges, Cantey placed one regiment there and another, the 37th Mississippi, atop a treeless ridge known as the \"bald hill.\" Johnston ordered a brigade of cavalry, Col. J. Warren Grigsby\u2019s, to ride for Resaca on May 8.\nMaj. Gen. James B. McPherson had his troops marching on the 9th with orders to strike the Rebels\u2019 railroad at or near Resaca. When Grigsby\u2019s troopers approached, the Federals fired, driving them back to the ridge line where the 37th Mississippi waited. A division of Federal infantry under Brig. Gen. Thomas Sweeny drove the Confederates across Camp Creek and back to Cantey\u2019s main line. Sweeny\u2019s troops occupied Bald Hill, and from there were able to see Resaca and the railroad bridge over the Oostanaula River.\nMcPherson had arrived, and instructed Sweeny\u2019s division to hold Bald Hill while he sent other troops probing to the northeast for an approach to the railroad. But McPherson lost his nerve; worried that Johnston would send troops to drive him back, he ordered Sweeny back to Snake Creek Gap. The Union infantry withdrew, abandoning Bald Hill. When Sherman learned this, he was disappointed \u201cbeyond measure,\u201d as he wrote to McPherson, telling him to dig in while he brought the rest of the army through Snake Creek Gap.\nBy May 14, Johnston\u2019s Confederate army was positioned north and west of Resaca, stretching four miles, with its left on the Oostanaula River and the right extending to the Conasauga. Camp Creek cut across most of Johnston\u2019s front, creating an additional obstacle for the Federals. As Sherman\u2019s forces marching from Snake Creek Gap paralleled Rebel lines, Sherman ordered attacks to keep the Rebels occupied while Sweeny\u2019s division of the Sixteenth Corps crossed the Oostanaula four miles downstream from Resaca, beyond the Confederates\u2019 left, to threaten the railroad.\nStarting around 11:30 a.m. Yankees from the Maj. Gen John Schofield\u2019s Twenty-third and Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard\u2019s Fourth Corps attacked across rough terrain; Camp Creek, \u201cwith quicksand in places, and steep muddy banks,\u201d proved a formidable obstacle indeed. Schofield\u2019s two divisions charged and failed. One brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Judah\u2019s division never got past Camp Creek. The Fourteenth Corps divisions of Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird\u2019s and Brig. Gen. Richard Johnson also charged, managing to cross the creek before withdrawing under heavy musketry and cannon fire. Brig. Gen. Jacob Cox\u2019s division of Schofield\u2019s corps entered the battle after Judah\u2019s and was also thrown back.\nOn the Confederate line Maj. Gen. Pat Cleburne\u2019s and Maj. Gen. Thomas Hindman\u2019s divisions helped repel the attacks, but Maj. Gen. William Bate\u2019s division bore the brunt of them.\nThe Federal assault on the Confederate center-right petered out around 3 p.m., having achieved nothing but casualties\u2014at least 1,600 killed and wounded. Following their failed attacks, Thomas and Schofield ordered artillery to shell the Rebel works. After adding casualties from the bombardment, the Confederates probably lost between 400 and 500 men in the Camp Creek fighting on May 14.\nThe next morning, Lt. Gen. John B. Hood instructed his division commander Maj. Gen. Carter Stevenson to position a battery so as to bear on enemy artillery \"annoying General Hindman\u2019s line.\" Stevenson ordered Capt. Maximilian Van Den Corput\u2019s \u201cCherokee Battery\u201d of four Napoleons to be placed 20 yards in front of his entrenched infantry. Soldiers constructed an earthen lunette for the guns, but before they could connect it to their main line with rifle pits, Federals attacked the center-right of the Confederate line. They were repulsed elsewhere, but two Federal regiments of Brig. Gen. John Ward\u2019s brigade stormed up to the Rebel earthworks. By then Van Den Corput\u2019s infantry supports had run away and his troops \"entered the embrasures, striking down and bayoneting the rebel gunners, many of whom defiantly stood by their guns till struck down.\"\nThe Northerners received heavy fire and withdrew, leaving the battery unmanned. Neither side could sortie forward to reclaim the battery. By 3 p.m. both sides resorted to heavy skirmishing and artillery dueling while the Confederate cannon sat in no-man\u2019s land. \u201cCome on\u2014take those guns!\u201d yelled the Southerners. \u201cCome on and take \u2018em yourselves!\u201d came the Northerners\u2019 reply. After dark, Brig. Gen. John Geary ordered troops to sneak forward, quietly dig through the earthwork, and with ropes drag the four guns back into Union lines. The mission was successful. While all this was taking place on Johnston\u2019s right, Sweeny\u2019s Yankee division crossed the Oostanaula below the Confederate left. Realizing he had been flanked, the Confederate commander ordered his troops to withdraw on the night of May 15-16.", "union_casualties": "2747", "name": "Resaca", "id": "resaca", "total_casualties": "5,547", "union_strength": "9", "battle_dates": "May 13 - 15, 1864", "confederate_casualties": "2800", "total_strength": "158,787", "result": "Inconclusive", "confederate_strength": "6", "campaign": "Atlanta Campaign", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/resaca.html", "location": "Gordon County and Whitfield County, Georgia", "union_commanders": [{"name": "William T.

Never one to forfeit the initiative, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee resolved to take the war once again onto Northern soil.\nBeginning June 3, the Army of Northern Virginia marched west from Fredericksburg towards Culpeper Court House, on its way to the protection of the Shenandoah Valley. Lee ordered Gen. J.E.B. Stuart\u2019s cavalry to screen this movement, keeping the southern bank of the Rappahannock free of Union scouts. By June 8, roughly 9,500 of Stuart\u2019s cavalrymen were concentrated at Brandy Station, a small crossroads roughly halfway between Culpeper and the Rappahannock. In preparation for his pivot northward, Lee directed Stuart to launch a diversionary raid across the river the next day, June 9.\nGen. Joseph Hooker, commanding the Union Army of the Potomac, correctly interpreted Stuart\u2019s intentions. Redeploying his own cavalry opposite Brandy Station, he too ordered an attack for June 9. After the perceived failure of the mounted wing during the Chancellorsville Campaign, Hooker\u2019s orders were plain: \"disperse or destroy\" Stuart\u2019s entire command. Cavalry commander Gen. Alfred Pleasanton accordingly augmented his striking force with an ad hoc infantry brigade, bringing his strength to nearly 12,000 men. Stuart remained unaware of this rapid build-up of strength to his front. Pleasanton\u2019s plan had called for a coordinated double attack by Gen. John Buford\u2019s troopers at Beverly\u2019s Ford and a force under Gen. David Gregg further south at Kelly\u2019s Ford.\nAt 4:30 A.M., Buford\u2019s men splashed across Beverly\u2019s Ford, four and a half miles northeast of Brandy Station, and quickly scattered surprised Confederate pickets. Firing their revolvers wildly, the pickets scrambled back towards the main camp near St. James Church, along the direct road to Brandy Station from Beverly\u2019s Ford. Bleary-eyed Confederates at St. James Church hurled themselves into the fray and managed to stall Buford\u2019s advance, claiming the life of Buford\u2019s lead subordinate, Col. Benjamin \"Grimes\" Davis.\n\n\n\nStuart's horsemen suffered heavily, but bought enough time for their artillery to deploy and open a murderous fire on the congested Union column from the high ground around the church. His position in peril, Buford ordered a desperate charge on the Confederate battery. The 6th Pennsylvania led the assault with the 6th U.S. close behind. Undeterred by the canister and shrapnel scything through their ranks, the Union horsemen overran the guns before Brig. Gen. \"Grumble\" Jones's Confederates repulsed them.\nWith the guns back in action, Buford now sought to reach them by moving around the Confederate left flank on Yew Ridge. Dismounted Confederate troopers repulsed repeated attacks from behind a stone wall before being dislodged at around noon.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, delays were plaguing Gen. David Gregg\u2019s Federal horsemen at Kelly\u2019s Ford. Gregg\u2019s scouted alerted him of the presence of Confederates in his front, prompting the Pennsylvanian to make a wide march around the enemy. It was 11:30 A.M. before Gregg reached Brandy Station, but he was now firmly in the Confederate rear.\nGregg\u2019s path to St. James Church was blocked by Fleetwood Hill, a broad elevation where J.E.B. Stuart had established his headquarters. Union artillery opened on Fleetwood Hill, giving a considerable shock to Stuart, whose main force was entirely committed to the battle in his front. Gregg\u2019s preparatory barrage, however, gave Stuart time to pull troops back to Fleetwood Hill to meet the first Union charge. Meanwhile, Confederates withdrawing from Yew Ridge were still holding Buford\u2019s tired troopers at bay, allowing Stuart to shuffle more troops to face Gregg. The opposing lines crashed into one another again and again for almost five hours. Finally, hearing reports of incoming Confederate reinforcements, Pleasanton decided to withdraw at 5 P.M.

Nathaniel Banks, led roughly 30,000 men up the Red River in a movement that had been conceived in part by former General-in-Chief, Henry Halleck. Banks\u2019 mission was to destroy the Confederate army under Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor and capture Shreveport, Louisiana, thus seizing control of the Red River, and further tightening the Federals\u2019 grip on the Confederacy. Though this movement was not line with Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s unified strategy for the Federal army, the plan was approved and Banks\u2019 expedition began.\nRetreating up the river for most of March, Taylor was slowly collecting reinforcements from Texas and Arkansas, while he looked for a place to make a stand. Finally, in April, Taylor chose a clearing just south of Mansfield as an idea location to strike a blow at the Yankees, and possibly turn the tide of the campaign. Fully aware that his Confederates were outnumbered nearly two to one, Taylor said he would \"fight Banks here [Mansfield] if he has a million men.\"\nTaylor knew the Union force would not be routed easily. He created a trap, stationing his men across Mansfield Road in an arc formation, just on the north side of an open field. Maj. Gen. John G. Walker\u2019s three brigades were then placed in a battle line approximately 500 yards on either side of the road. Walker\u2019s force was to take the first hit, with Brig. Gen. Alfred Mouton\u2019s two brigades on Walker\u2019s left there to attack once the Union forces were engaged. Brig. Gen. Thomas Green\u2019s cavalry edged out both flanks. Upon the Union\u2019s arrival, Brig. Gen. Thomas Ransom led a brigade forward but, concerned about hidden Confederate forces, halted. Banks ordered an advance that afternoon, but was rebuffed by Brig. Gen. Albert Lee, who insisted their position was too precarious. Banks reconsidered and called for additional cavalry reinforcements. While Banks waited, Taylor sent his infantry and a battery of artillery forward in an effort to draw the Federals into battle.\nAfter the Yankees failed to take the bait, Taylor ordered the advance of the entire Confederate line. Immediately, Mouton\u2019s division encountered difficulties in the center of the line. Though Mouton managed to rally his men, he was mortally wounded. Walker, however, fared better on the Federal left, and forced a Union retreat in that sector. Very soon, the collapse on Banks\u2019 left led to withdrawal along the whole line, and eventually devolved into a rout in which the Yankees left three pieces of artillery in Confederate hands.\nBanks, finally understanding the gravity of the situation, called for additional reinforcements. Brig. Gen. Robert Cameron\u2019s division of the Thirteenth Army Corps hastened to the front to bolster the line, but was delayed by the Federals\u2019 own supply trains. After extricating his troops, Cameron established a battle line approximately one mile south of Moss Plantation. Once more, the Confederates rolled up the Union line. Flush with success, Taylor pushed Walker\u2019s, Polignac\u2019s (who had taken command of Mouton\u2019s division), and Green\u2019s divisions forward, adding to the confusion of the Union retreat.\nFederal reinforcements, however, were coming to stem the flood. Without orders, Brig. Gen. William H. Emory quickened his pace to the front, leading his Nineteenth Corps towards the battle. Emory knew a defensible post was vital to support the retreating Federals and to prevent additional Confederate advances. He found a hill bordered by Chatman Bayou Creek and a small orchard, called Pleasant Grove, and decided to make his stand there. He placed approximately 5,000 men across Mansfield Road, forming a wall of soldiers with their rifles aimed at the advancing Confederates. When the Rebels tested this line, Emory\u2019s fire sent them back in a brief retreat.\nRefusing to surrender their progress for the day, the Confederates again attacked, this time on the flanks in hopes of rolling up the line as they had done earlier. Seeing this, Emory refused his line, bending it back to repel the Confederates again. Unable to break through, the Rebels retreated as darkness fell.\nThough Taylor was frustrated with the outcome of the day, Mansfield was still a strategic victory for the Confederates. Taylor displayed excellent generalship, maneuvering his force to overwhelm individual parts of the larger Union army. Taylor and his Confederates also captured more pieces of Union army equipment and artillery, and sustained approximately 1,000 casualties. In comparison, the Union army sustained 2,800 casualties and was unable to seize nearly as many Confederate supplies.", "union_casualties": "2900", "name": "Mansfield", "id": "mansfield", "total_casualties": "4,400", "union_strength": "1", "battle_dates": "April 8, 1864", "confederate_casualties": "1500", "total_strength": "19,000", "result": "Confederate Victory", "confederate_strength": "7", "campaign": "Red River Campaign", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/mansfield.html", "location": "DeSoto Parish, Louisiana", "union_commanders": [{"name": "Nathaniel Banks", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/nathaniel-banks.html"}], "alternate_names": "Sabine Cross-Roads, Pleasant Grove", "confederate_commanders": [{"name": "Richard Taylor", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/richard-taylor.html"}]}, {"campaign": "Franklin-Nashville Campaign", "result": "Union Victory", "union_casualties": "425", "name": "Spring Hill", "id": "spring-hill", "confederate_casualties": "275", "union_commanders": [{"name": "John M.

Gen. Ulysses S. Grant knew he had to force Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia from their trenches. Despite heavy losses, Grant would not withdraw, hoping one more battle would prove a decisive Union victory. To bring the Confederates to battle, Grant offered Lee a potential prize\u2014the entire Union Second Corps. Grant ordered Maj. Gen. George G. Meade to send the corps toward Hanover Junction, a vital rail junction just south of the North Anna River, using the Mattaponi River as a shield. Lee would have to react to such a threat to his supply line and Richmond. Once Lee came out of his earthworks, Grant could strike.\nLee was puzzled by Grant\u2019s movements early on May 21, but he had no intention of attacking the Second Corps. No matter Grant's intent, Lee knew he had to cover the inside route to Richmond and protect his supply line. Lee determined to fall back to a favorable defense line along the North Anna River, where the river itself would funnel Grant's army to limited crossings that were easily defendable. Meanwhile, a brush with Confederate infantry at Milford Station that same day convinced Hancock that he should not move any further south without additional support. Grant soon began to draw the disparate corps of the Army of the Potomac together to move south toward the North Anna.\nAfter extricating themselves from a tremendous traffic jam, the lead elements of the Union army, Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren\u2019s Fifth Corps and Hancock\u2019s Second, approached the North Anna River on May 23. Hancock moved toward Chesterfield Bridge over the river and a small redoubt manned by Col. John W. Henagan\u2019s South Carolinian brigade. Despite sending repeated messengers to the rear as they watched Union skirmishers advance, Henagan received no reinforcements, nor any orders of retreat. Shortly after 6:00 p.m., an artillery barrage prefaced an infantry attack by Hancock\u2019s men who scrambled up the Confederate defenses and chased the Rebels across the river. That same day, Warren\u2019s corps crossed the river unopposed at Jericho Mill. That evening, Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill struck Warren, nearly throwing Federals back across the North Anna. Though surprised, the Yankees rallied and the Confederates fell back. Lee's North Anna River line was breached.\nUsing terrain and Grant's own aggressive spirit against him, Lee hoped draw the Union army into a trap. A strong salient\u2014the \u201cinverted\u201d\u2014anchored on the dominant bluffs at Ox Ford, became the centerpiece of Lee\u2019s defensive position which was almost impregnable. Should Grant advance, he would break his army into three parts\u2014one on the Telegraph Road, another at Ox Ford, and a third at Jericho Mills. Each flank would have to cross the river twice to reinforce the other. Grant would surely attack, giving Lee the chance to pin a large mass of the enemy army against the river.\nTrouble by the lack of movement in his center, Grant ordered his only available unit, Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside\u2019s Ninth Corps, to move toward Ox Ford on May 24. Finding the Confederate defenses there too strong, Burnside sent Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden's division to cross above Ox Ford and come in from behind and another division over the Chesterfield Bridge to clear the ford from the opposite direction. With two divisions converging on Ox Ford, Burnside hoped the Confederates would withdraw. Once across, however, Crittenden discovered exceptionally strong enemy trench lines\u2014more than one division could handle alone. Unfortunately, a rash order from a drunk officer, Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, sent a brigade of Federals to within 100 yards of the Rebel works where they were quickly swept from the field.\nThat same day, Hancock pushed his entire corps across the Chesterfield Bridge. That afternoon the Federals ran into Confederate skirmishers, sparking a furious firefight that devolved into a hand-to-hand struggle near the Doswell house. Darkness ended the fighting and Grant ordered his commanders to halt and dig in.\nOn May 25, Grant evaluated Lee's position and admitted, \"To make a direct attack from either wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not justify.\" His army was split in three: the Fifth and Sixth Corps at Jericho Mill, a lone division of Burnside's command on the north side of Ox Ford, and Hancock's corps at Doswell.

Unrelenting, Hood continued to drag his bloodied Army of Tennessee, approximately 30,000 strong, north towards the capital city, which was now protected by John Schofield\u2019s Army of the Ohio as well as George Thomas\u2019s Army of the Cumberland.\nThe presence of these two battle-hardened legions, numbering some 55,000 men between them, would ordinarily have precluded further offensive operations. But John Bell Hood was a determined man and his situation was dire\u2014at that same moment Sherman\u2019s vandals were nearing the gates of Savannah, Georgia. By recapturing the manufacturing and supply center at Nashville, Hood sought to draw the wrathful Ohioan into a wasted pursuit and thus spare the citizens of the Confederacy further harm.\nIn fact, Hood\u2019s designs went beyond simply taking Nashville. After taking the city, he planned to move north into his home state of Kentucky to gather provisions and volunteers, and then turn east to join Robert E. Lee\u2019s beleaguered forces in Virginia, all while keeping ahead of Sherman\u2019s army. Given the reluctance of Kentuckians to rally to the Stars and Bars during the 1862 Heartland Offensive, when Confederate prospects were not nearly so dim as in the winter of 1864, the two-limbed general\u2019s plan was exceptionally optimistic.\nHood reached Nashville on December 2 and began to stake out a position south of the city, hoping to draw the Union forces into a costly attack. In his headquarters in Nashville, ranking general George Thomas received telegrams from Ulysses S. Grant and Abraham Lincoln urging him to strike the Confederate army. He delayed the attack for nearly two weeks, citing freezing temperatures, full-blown ice storms, and limited cavalry support, but his superiors were unimpressed. Grant himself was on his way to Nashville to remove Thomas from command when he received word that the heavy-set \u201cRock of Chickamauga\u201d had finally moved forward.\nThe Union battle plan for December 15 called for a demonstration on the Confederate right across the line of the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad while the main assault struck a cluster of immense earthen redoubts on the Confederate left.\nThe diversionary attack was led by one of the army\u2019s least disciplined brigades (described as a collection \u201cnew conscripts, convalescents, and bounty jumpers\u201d by their own commanding officer) and supported by a brigade of United States Colored Troops. Both formations splintered against the Confederate right flank. The pressure failed to draw Hood\u2019s attention or his resources, and he was able to pull men out of line on the right to reinforce his more threatened left.\nTo the west, fierce close-range combat erupted as Thomas\u2019s men swept over the redoubts. They fell into Union hands one by one throughout the afternoon. Hood retreated two miles further south during the night and reorganized his force in preparation for another hard day.\nThomas renewed the attack on the afternoon of December 16.\u00a0 He followed the pattern of the first day, hoping to pin the Confederate right while smashing the left. This time the diversion was successful. The Southerners defending Peach Orchard Hill repulsed the four-brigade Union attack, but they could not spare any reinforcements.\nThe Confederate left was anchored on a rise known as Compton\u2019s Hill. Union Maj. Gen. John Schofield had been chosen to lead the day\u2019s attack. Instead, Schofield delayed. The long-bearded New Yorker was proving to be a less than capable battlefield commander. Finally, with the sun about to set, Brig. Gen. John McArthur, on his own initiative, ordered his three brigades to charge the hill.\nMcArthur\u2019s attack broke the Confederate line and soon threatened to sweep up Hood\u2019s whole army. Col. William Shy of the 20th Tennessee died trying to hold off the Union onslaught\u2014Compton\u2019s Hill was renamed Shy\u2019s Hill in his honor.\nHood ordered a hasty retreat south along the Granny White and Franklin Pikes. Only a skillful rearguard action allowed the army to escape from the battlefield. Thomas\u2019s strategic pursuit over the next two weeks also failed to trap the Confederates, but the damage had been done.

Gen. Sterling Price\u2019s Army of the West main column marched into Iuka, Mississippi, on September 14. Price\u2019s superior, Gen. Braxton Bragg, the commander of the Confederate Army of the Mississippi, who was leading an offensive deep into Kentucky, ordered him to prevent Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans\u2019s Army of the Mississippi troops from moving into Middle Tennessee and reinforcing Brig. Gen. James Negley\u2019s division of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell\u2019s Army of the Ohio, which was garrisoning Nashville. Price had about 14,000 men, and he was informed that, if necessary, he could request assistance from Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, commanding the District of the Mississippi, headquartered at Holly Springs. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, commanding the Army of the Tennessee, feared that Price intended to go north to join Bragg against Buell. Grant devised a plan for his left wing commander, Maj. Gen. E.O.C. Ord, and his men to advance on Iuka from the west; Rosecrans\u2019s forces were to march from the southwest, arrive at Iuka on the 18th, and make a coordinated attack the next day. Ord arrived on time and skirmishing ensued between his reconnaissance patrol and Confederate pickets, about six miles from Iuka, before nightfall. Rosecrans informed Grant that he would not arrive at Iuka on the 18th but would begin his march at 4:30 am, the next morning. On the 19th, Ord sent Price a message demanding that he surrender, but Price refused. At the same time, Price received dispatches from Van Dorn suggesting that their two armies rendezvous, as soon as possible, at Rienzi for attacks on the Federal forces in the area. Price informed Van Dorn that the military situation had changed so he could not evacuate Iuka immediately. He did, however, issue orders for his men to prepare for a march the next day, to rendezvous with Van Dorn. Rosecrans\u2019s army marched early on the 19th, but, instead of using two roads as directed, it followed the Jacinto (Bay Springs) Road. After considering the amount of time that Rosecrans required to reach Iuka, Grant determined that he probably would not arrive on the 19th, so he ordered Ord to await the sound of fighting between Rosecrans and Price before engaging the Confederates. As Rosecrans advanced, his men fought actions with Confederate troops at points along the way. About 4:00 pm, just after ascending a hill, the Union column halted because the Confederates were well-placed below in a ravine, filled with timber and underbrush. The Confederates launched attacks up the hill, capturing a six-gun Ohio battery, while the Federals counterattacked from the ridge. Fighting, which Price later stated he had \u201cnever seen surpassed,\u201d continued until after dark; the Union troops camped for the night behind the ridge. Price had redeployed troops from Ord\u2019s front to fight against Rosecrans\u2019s people. Ord did nothing, later proclaiming that he never heard any fighting and, therefore, never engaged the enemy; Grant also remarked that he had heard no sounds of battle. Following the fighting on the 19th, Price determined to reengage the enemy the next day, but his subordinates convinced him, instead, to march to join Van Dorn, as earlier planned. At the same time, Rosecrans redeployed his men for fighting the next day. Price\u2019s army evacuated via the uncovered Fulton Road, protected its rear with a heavy rearguard and hooked up with Van Dorn five days later at Ripley. Although Rosecrans was supposed to traverse Fulton Road and cover it, he stated that he had not guarded the road because he feared dividing his force; Grant later approved this decision. Rosecrans\u2019s army occupied Iuka and then mounted a pursuit; the Confederate rearguard and overgrown terrain prevented the Union pursuit from accomplishing much. The Federals should have destroyed or captured Price\u2019s army, but instead the Rebels joined Van Dorn and assaulted Corinth in October."}, {"campaign": null, "union_casualties": "71", "name": "Dranesville", "id": "dranesville", "union_strength": "4000", "confederate_casualties": "230", "union_commanders": [{"name": "Edward O.

Bate's division, on the Confederate left, to \"develop the enemy\" near Dallad and \"ascertain his strength and position, as it is believed he is not in force.\" Some of Bate's men already knew that the enemy lines ahead were fortified and still occupied with the infantry and artillery of Gen. James B. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee. Lt. Col. Franklin Montgomery of the 1st Mississippi Cavalry wrote that he had taken \"a good look at a part of their works, which seemed very strong, and I no doubt were well manned.\" But General Bate believed that he faced only an enemy skirmish line. Kentuckian John S. Jackman commented in his diary, \"the boys generally know what is in front and could have told Gen. Bate better.\"\nBy 3:00pm, Bate had formed his plan. Brig. Gen. Frank Armstrong's brigade of dismounted cavalry would charge the Yankee line; if they encountered strong opposition, they were to retire. If not, they would press their attack toward the right. Two artillery shots would signal Bate's three infantry brigades to then advance.\u00a0\nAround 3:45pm, Armstrong's troops sallied forth, so suddenly that they drove the Yankees back and captured three cannon. But Maj. Gen. John A. Logan organized a counterattack that drove the Mississippians back to their lines. General Bate sent couriers to his three brigade commanders to cancel their attack, but only one of them received the order. The brigades of Col. Robert Bullock and Brig. Gen. Joseph Lewis charged the strong Federal lines and were bloodily repulsed. Confederate losses totaled 1,200. Logan reported 379 casualties in his three divisions engaged.\u00a0\nBoth sides spent May 29 watchfully waiting in lines anywhere from 200 yards to a half-mile apart. Skirmishers were active, peppering the other side, and artillerymen kept up their fire. \"During the day all rather quiet Sharpshooting,\" recorded an officer on Johnston's staff. On the 30th, Sherman wanted his forces to start withdrawing from the Dallas-New Hope-Pickett's Mill lines for a move back toward the railroad. He had flanked Johnston out of Allatoona, and now it was time to move back to his line of supply, and on to Acworth. McPherson, however, had difficulty disengaging from the Rebels (Bate's division in his front). On June 1, the Army of the Tennessee carefully withdrew and started marching northeastward.\u00a0\nJohnston received reports of the enemy movement from observers in Elsberry Mountain. To parallel Sherman's eastward march and to block his next advance, Johnston chose to place his next defensive line at Lost Mountain, six miles southeast of the Confederates' New Hope line.

Lee led his Army of Northern Virginia in its second invasion of the North\u2014the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to collect supplies in the abundant Pennsylvania farmland and take the fighting away from war-ravaged Virginia. He wanted to threaten Northern cities, weaken the North's appetite for war and, especially, win a major battle on Northern soil and strengthen the peace movement in the North. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his Union Army of the Potomac in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle. Hooker's successor, Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade moved northward, keeping his army between Lee and Washington, D.C. When Lee learned that Meade was in Pennsylvania, Lee concentrated his army around Gettysburg.\nElements of the two armies collided west and north of the town on July 1, 1863. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford slowed the Confederate advance until Union infantry, the Union 1st and 11th Corps, arrived. More Confederate reinforcements under generals A.P. Hill and Richard Ewell reached the scene, however, and 30,000 Confederates ultimately defeated 20,000 Yankees, who fell back through Gettysburg to the hills south of town--Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill.\nOn the second day of battle, the Union defended a fishhook-shaped range of hills and ridges south of Gettysburg with around 90,000 soldiers. Confederates essentially wrapped around the Union position with 70,000 soldiers. On the afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Devil's Den, Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard and Cemetery Ridge. On the Union right, demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and East Cemetery Hill. Although the Confederates gained ground, the Union defenders still held strong positions by the end of the day.\nOn July 3, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,000 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge--Pickett's Charge. The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great losses to the Confederate army. Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia. As many as 51,000 soldiers from both armies were killed, wounded, captured or missing in the three-day battle.

Gen. George B. McClellan's confidence in his plan to capture Richmond. The June 26 battle and the belief that Stonewall Jackson's troops were still lurking somewhere off to his right and rear convinced McClellan that his lengthy supply train with its heavy siege guns were vulnerable to attack. In the pre-dawn hours of June 27, 1862 the commander of the Army of the Potomac issued a flurry of orders to his subordinates to move or abandon their supply trains and make a beeline for the James River where they would be protected by artillery fire from naval gun boats. Though he would never admit it, McClellan was retreating; the campaign to take Richmond was over. \u00a0\nTo his most trusted subordinate, Fifth Corps commander Fitz-John Porter, McClellan assigned the task of holding the Federal line north of the Chickahominy River. Dawn broke over Porter\u2019s men as they abandoned their position along Beaver Dam Creek and withdrew to a new line behind marshy creek called Boatswain\u2019s Swamp. Here the Fifth Corps infantrymen were arrayed in an arc roughly one and three-quarters of a mile long while Yankee artillery stood guard over the bridges across the Chickahominy. Though slightly weaker than the position on the 26th, the Boatswain's Swamp was still a rather formidable obstacle, and the largely open farmland of the Watt, Adams, and McGehee families provided excellent fields of fire. With his troops aligned for battle, Porter was determined to withstand whatever the Rebels threw at him, \"even to my destruction.\"\nGen. Robert E. Lee was determined to take advantage of the opportunity in front of him. His first offensive stroke as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia had prompted his opponent to surrender the initiative. Now Porter's entire corps was isolated north of the Chickahominy and Lee intended to destroy it. The Virginian sent word to Stonewall Jackson to link up with the main force before advancing on the Chickahominy.\u00a0\nA series of disjointed assaults by the divisions of A. P. Hill and D. H. Hill demonstrated the strength of the Federal position and yielded some of the highest casualties the war had yet seen. Additional troops under Richard S. Ewell and James Longstreet also pitched into the fray, but were unable to breach the Yankee line. Meanwhile, Porter's men held firm but were badly in need of reinforcement. Unfortunately, troops from the Sixth Corps had destroyed the nearest bridge over the Chickahominy, thus preventing the reinforcements from arriving in a timely fashion. When elements of the Sixth and Second corps finally arrived, it was too little too late. By then Jackson's men had arrived on the field and lent their weight to a twilight assault that ultimately overran the Union line.\nOnly darkness prevented a total catastrophe. Under the cover of night, Porter's men limped across the Chickahominy and set fire to the bridges behind them. The third of the Seven Days had ended in a resounding Confederate victory.", "union_commanders": [{"name": "Fitz John Porter", "url": "http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/fitz-john-porter.html"}, {"name": "George B.
