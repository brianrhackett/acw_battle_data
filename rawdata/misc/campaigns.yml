    The only CWSAC battle in this is the Battle of Baxter Springs.
    The Union forces hasd already established a presence in Kansas with Fort Blair.
    If the objective was to capture Fort Blair, Quantrail failed. But given
    his guerilla tactics, the objective was likely to harass Union forces,
    at which he succeeded

    The objective of the Red River Campaign was to control the interior of
    Louisiana. Forces commanded by Nathaniel Banks would move along the
    Red River to Shreveport to link with forces commanded by Frederick Steele.
    Union forces suffered defeats at the Battle of Mansfield and Pleasant Hill
    and failed to achieve its objectives.

    A Union army spring offensive. Forces commanded by Frederick Steele
    were to move to Shreveport, Louisiana  to link with other Union forces
    commanded by Nathaniel Banks and David Porter. The larger objective
    was to assert control over southern Arkansas.  Union forces suffered
    defeats at the Battle of Mansfield and Marks' Mills and failed to capture
    Shreveport or Texas.

    Union forces commanded by Alfred Sully were to secure a line
    of communication and transportation to Montana and Idaho, and remove
    the Sioux Threat. The Union forces defeat Sioux forces at the Battles of
    Killdeer and Badlands, and push most Sioux west of the Missouri.
