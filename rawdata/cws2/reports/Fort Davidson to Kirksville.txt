Militia Cavalry [US]; Army of Missouri [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

4,556.30 acres
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area boundary significantly. The
larger Study Area encompasses the initial Confederate approach from
the east to the “Shut-ins;” the site of the Confederate encampment
on the southern side of Shepherd Mountain; Confederate troop
movements on and around Shepherd Mountain; Federal troop
movements on Pilot Knob; Confederate troop movements above Fort
Davidson (made in an attempt to attack Fort Davidson from the
north); the sites of the two Confederate encampments north of the
town of Pilot Knob between which withdrawing Union troops had to
pass under cover of darkness; and the Union route of withdrawal from
the fort to the northwest.
Because the combatants fought over the same middle ground
repeatedly during the two-day battle, the two original CWSAC Core
Areas were expanded and merged to create a single Core Area. This
new Core Area encompasses areas where fighting took place on
either, or both, September 26 and 27. It includes the initial point of
contact at the “Shut-ins”and areas of subsequent engagement in
Arcadia and Ironton on the 26th, and the areas of fighting in the gap,
on the mountains, and around Fort Davidson on the 27th.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. The battlefield landscape has been
severely altered due the growth of the towns of Pilot Knob,
Ironton, and Acadia. The two most prominent topographical
features to survive are Pilot Knob and Shepherd Mountain. Pilot
Knob is permanently protected by the US Fish and Wildlife
Service. Shepherd Mountain is owned by the City of Ironton. In
this case, however, the city’s ownership does not imply perpetual
protection. In its March 2005 Conceptual Development Plan, the
Fort Davidson State Historic Site stated that, “the City of Ironton
maintains a lease-purchase agreement that designates Shepherd
Mountain as a local natural area park; however, the phrase
‘natural area park’ is not clearly defined in the agreement
language nor is a list provided of acceptable or unacceptable
types of development. The division would like to ensure
preservation of Shepherd Mountain’s scenic vista. For this reason,
the division proposes to enter a scenic easement agreement with
the City of Ironton to protect the mountain from residential and
commercial expansion, while providing the opportunity for
potential trail and overlook development.” If a perpetual
easement can be placed on the city’s land, then nearly all of the
surviving historic landscape will be secure from development in
perpetuity.

Study Area

1,105.80 acres
The 1993 Study Area was revised to include the routes of approach
used by the two columns of Union troops (one from Cape Girardeau
and the other from Pilot Knob) converging to the north of the town
of Fredericktown. The ABPP also included the route taken by the
retreating Confederate and pursuing Federal troops to the south. The
Study Area was enlarged around the Core Area to the west to include
the area where the Union line wheeled against Thompson’s force in
the cornfield opposite the Union left.

Condition Statement

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The battlefield landscape has been altered due
to the growth of Fredericktown. The southern portion of the
battlefield has been compromised by residential development
around Millcreek and the construction of numerous roads since
the Civil War, most recently the new route of the four-lane US 67
and a diamond interchange just south of Millcreek. The 447 acres
of battlefield that retain integrity will likely experience
development pressure within the next five years, especially along
US 67 Business between Fredericktown and Millcreek. Protection
efforts are needed immediately to preserve the last cohesive
portion of the Core Area and surrounding landscape.

Results

Confederate victory

Study Area

1,769.38 acres
Although the battlefield was surveyed in 1993, the CWSAC did not
delineate a Study Area or a Core Area for Glasgow. The ABPP’s new
Study Area includes 1) the location of Shelby’s battery on the west
side of the Missouri River, 2) Clark’s approach from the south (starting
from the position where the Confederates first heard Shelby's guns
shelling the town), 3) the main engagement area south of the town,
4) areas of troop movement east and north of town, and 5) the
cavalry engagement north of town.
Two Core Areas have been identified. The larger Core Area represents
the main area of fighting, which includes the Confederate line of
battle and batteries to the south, the fields of fighting to the south
and east of the town, and locations where fighting took place within
the town itself. This Core Area extends to the west to include the
location of Shelby's guns. The second, smaller Core Area represents
the location where elements of Hardin’s cavalry defended the
northern approach into the town of Glasgow from attacking
Confederate horsemen commanded by Colonel Robert Lawther.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. Only land to the south of the City of
Glasgow survives with integrity. Conversion of farmland for
industrial development south of Gregg's Creek continues to
destroy what little Core Area terrain survives. Immediate
protection efforts are needed to save the last Core Area parcels.

Study Area

7,654.60 acres
The ABPP revised the 1993 Study Area and extended the Confederate
approach route to Marshville where Porter and Marmaduke's forces
met prior to moving east. The Confederate flanking maneuver
around Merrill's position at Wood's Fork, the Confederate route of
retreat toward Houston, and the Union route of retreat towards
Lebanon were also added to the Study Area.
The ABPP added a new Core Area at Wood's Fork where Federal and
Confederate forces first clashed. The Core Area at Hartsville was
adjusted slightly to better represent the range of artillery used by
both forces.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. Growth around Hartville is pushing out
to the west and south, bringing residential and commercial
development along State Routes 38 and 5. Only the eastern
portion of the Core Area at Hartville retains integrity. The entire
Core Area at the rural crossroads at Odin retains integrity. With
the exception of continued growth around Hartville and along
roadways throughout the Study Area, there are no specific threats
to the remaining battlefield landscape.

The ABPP adjusted the 1993 Study Area to more accurately align it
with the road used by Confederate forces to approach the center of
town (the modern Spring Road), and Walnut Road and Lexington
Road, which were used by Confederate forces to attack the Union
camp on the western edge of town.
The northern Core Area was adjusted to include the locations of
fighting around the courthouse square, the bank and barracks
buildings used by Federal forces, and the Independence Jail used by
the Provost Marshall. The second Core Area represents the location of
the Federal camp on the western edge of town that was assaulted by
a portion of the Confederate column.

Study Area

6,449.78 acres
The 1993 Study Area and Core Area did not accurately reflect the full
extent of the battle landscape. The ABPP expanded the Study Area to
include all of the locations of fighting, and realigned the boundaries
to follow the historic road network more closely. The ABPP added the
Union approach route to Independence from the east and the route
used by withdrawing Confederates to the southwest of town.
The ABPP expanded the Core Area significantly to include the initial
point of contact between Union and Confederate forces; the area of
subsequent fighting through the town of Independence; the
Confederate lines of battle in town; and areas of sustained
engagement along the Confederate route of withdrawal the
southwest. The portions of the Study Area and Core Area that
represent this southwestern movement end at a mileage point
described in action reports found in The War of the Rebellion: a
Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate
Armies.

Study Area

10,708.07 acres
The ABPP revised the 1993 Study Area to include the retreat route of
Confederate forces from Kirksville down towards New Cambria to
incorporate fighting that took place on August 8 and 9. The Federal
approaches to New Cambria along the railroad were also added.
These troops stumbled into Porter’s scouts east of New Cambria and
initiated the two-day running engagement back up the Chariton
River.
The Core Areas were revised to represent the initial expulsion of
Porter’s Confederates from Kirksville by a smaller but better trained
and well-equipped Federal force on August 6, the rearguard ambush
at Painter's Creek on August 8, a second rearguard action at Walnut
Creek in the early morning hours of August 9, and the final skirmish
which took place later that day at Seesford as Confederate forces
retreated across the Chariton River.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving

has been overwhelmed by the growth of the town; however, the
remaining battlefield is a good candidate for selective landscape
protection. The historic road network and secondary Core Areas
at Painter’s Creek, Walnut Creek, and Seesford have integrity and
there are no specific threats to the remaining battlefield
landscape. Kirksville presents an opportunity for battlefield
preservation and interpretation over the long term.
