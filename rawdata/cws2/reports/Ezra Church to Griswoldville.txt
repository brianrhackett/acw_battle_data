Study Area

2,719.21 acres
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area to include the route taken
by Federal forces to the west in an attempt to reach the Western &
Atlantic Railroad and the area through which Confederate troops
moved out of their defensive works to strike the Federals near Ezra
Church. The Study Area and the Core Area were also adjusted to
illustrate the rough, high contours of the battlefield’s terrain.

Fort McAllister I (GA002)
Location

Bryan County; Chatham County

Campaign

Naval Attacks on Fort McAllister (1863)

Battle Date(s)

March 3, 1863

Principal Commanders

Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont [US]; Captain George A. Anderson [CS]

Forces Engaged

Flotilla from the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron [US]; Fort
McAllister garrison [CS]

Results

Confederate victory

Study Area

2,494.48 acres
The CWSAC did not produce mapped boundaries for this battlefield
in 1993. The ABPP’s new Study Area contains the Federal flotilla’s
approach route from the bend of the Ogeechee River and the
Florida Passage—at which point the flotilla was committed to the
action—to the fort. The Core Area contains land covered by
opposing fields of fire and moving positions in the river of engaged
boats and ironclads.

Condition Statement

The battlefield’s high degree of integrity is tied to the relatively
unchanged nature and course of the Ogeechee River. Land and
marshlands within the Study Area that are not already protected
should be the focus of future preservation efforts. The earthen
fort itself was reconstructed in the late 1930s under the
philanthropic auspices of Henry Ford.

Fort McAllister II (GA028)
Location

Bryan County; Chatham County

Campaign

Savannah Campaign (1864)

Battle Date(s)

December 13, 1864

Principal Commanders

Brigadier General William B. Hazen [US]; Major George A.
Anderson [CS]

Forces Engaged

2nd Division, XV Army Corps [US]; Fort McAllister garrison [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

4,198.44 acres
The 1993 boundaries for Fort McAllister II incorrectly reflected the
naval bombardment of March 3, 1863. Therefore, the ABPP
produced new boundaries for the December 13, 1864, land battle.
The new boundaries include 1) the Federal approach route from
King's Bridge beginning where Federal forces crossed the Ogeechee
River to begin their assault on the fort; 2) the viewshed between
Sherman’s observation post at Cheves Plantation, from which he
signaled for the attack to begin, and Fort McAllister; and 3) the area
of engagement.

Condition Statement

Portions of the battlefield landscape have been altered, but most
essential features remain. Residential development and logging
are twin threats to the battlefield landscape. Two miles northwest
of Fort McAllister, the peninsula of Seven Mile Bend is completely
built out. Historic plantations along Fort McAllister Road have
been subdivided for estate homes, and commercial logging is
opening up more land for development south of the State’s Fort
McAllister Historic Park. The earthen fort itself was reconstructed
in the late 1930s under the philanthropic auspices of Henry Ford.
Protective measures, such as conservation easements, are needed
immediately to ensure the survival of battlefield land in this area.

Campaign

Operations against Fort Pulaski (1862)

Battle Date(s)

April 10-11, 1862

Principal Commanders

Major General David Hunter, Captain Quincy A. Gillmore [US];
Colonel Charles H. Olmstead [CS]

Forces Engaged

Port Royal Expeditionary Force [US]; Fort Pulaski garrison [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

8,529.53 acres (5,300.89 acres in Georgia; 3,159.06 acres in South
Carolina)
The ABPP found that portions of the 1993 Study Area had nothing
to do with the battle; those areas were removed. The Study Area
was redrawn to reflect the shoreline of the 1860s as well as the
movements of Union gunboats and the placement of Union
batteries. The Core Area was redrawn to include the positions of
the Union batteries engaged and their fields of fire.

itself a defining feature of the 1862 battle of Fort Pulaski.

Condition Statement

Much of the battlefield is in good condition and under protective
federal ownership. President Coolidge designated the Fort Pulaski
National Monument in 1924. It became part of the National Park
Service in 1933. The national monument contains Cockspur Island,
including Fort Pulaski itself, and McQueen’s Island on the south
side of the Savannah River. The US Fish and Wildlife Service’s
Tybee National Wildlife Refuge preserves most of the land in the
Study Area north of the Savannah River. The land between the
river’s north and south channels retains integrity, but is owned by
the Georgia Department of Transportation as a mitigation land
bank. Its future is uncertain.
Threats to the battlefield include dredging and widening of the
Savannah River channel to allow for passage of larger and faster
commercial ships, which in turn may cause larger and higher wave
action against the shorelines. The Georgia Department of
Transportation is planning to widen and elevate US Route 80 along
the edge of the battlefield Study Area. This project has the
potential to affect the historic viewshed. Finally, residential
development associated with the growth of the City of Tybee
Island has overwhelmed the positions of the 10 Federal batteries
that bombarded the fort in 1862. Immediate action to preserve
the privately-owned archeological sites of the last two Federal
batteries is necessary to avoid complete destruction of the Federal
positions.

Historical Designation

National Register of Historic Places (Fort Pulaski National
Monument, 1966)
Only 260 acres of Cockspur Island are listed. The remainder of the
Fort Pulaski National Monument, the land on McQueen’s Island, is
not listed for its association with the battle.

Location

Jones County; Twiggs County

Campaign

Savannah Campaign (1864)

Battle Date(s)

November 22, 1864

Principal Commanders

Brigadier General Charles C. Walcutt [US]; Major General Joseph
Wheeler, Brigadier General Pleasant J. Philips [CS]

Forces Engaged

2nd Brigade, 1st Division, XV Army Corps [US]; Wheeler's Cavalry
Corps, Department of South Carolina Georgia and Florida; and the
1st Division Georgia Militia [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

7,880.25 acres
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area to include the Federal
approach route, along which Walcutt’s force remained prepared to
intercept Wheeler’s cavalry, and to include the Georgia militia’s
route of march from Macon, during which it expected to encounter
Federal forces. The Core Area was expanded to the north to take in
the 9th Pennsylvania and 5th Kentucky’s cavalry charge against
Wheeler’s Cavalry Corps.

Condition Statement

Most of the Study Area retains a high degree of integrity. Sandy
Creek, its numerous branches, and Little Sandy Creek still frame the
bulk of the battlefield. The road network and the Central of
Georgia Railroad remain on their historic alignments. The open
fields and the ridge upon which the Federals camped and erected
their defense are intact. Because this historic landscape is not
currently in the path of development around the City of Macon,
Griswoldville represents one of the best opportunities for
comprehensive battlefield landscape preservation in Georgia over
the next ten years.
