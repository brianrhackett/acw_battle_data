Condition Statement

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. On the West Virginia side of the Potomac River,
only 10 percent of the surviving battlefield is permanently
protected. On the Maryland side, 63 percent of the surviving
battlefield is protected. Residential development in Jefferson
County is accelerating. New housing has already caused the loss of
the southern Core Area.
Coordinated public-private efforts are needed immediately to save
the remaining historic landscape.

The ABPP added several small Core Areas to reflect cavalry actions to
the south of the main fighting, especially at Berryville and Summit
Point, that helped prevent a Federal attack on the Confederate left
and rear. The revised Study Area includes these new Core Areas and
the Federal retreat route.

roads and railroad retain their original alignment. Numerous
battle-related historic farmsteads survive, notably Cedar Lawn,
Richwood, and Harewood.
Jefferson County is the fastest growing county in West Virginia,
and development pressure around Charles Town is severe.
In the 1990s, a golf course and residential community built on the
former Locust Hill farm obliterated much of the main Union
position. Continued residential development will destroy other
fragile battlefield resources. The Confederate position west of
Earle Road is especially at risk.
Immediate advocacy and protection efforts are needed at Summit
Point.
