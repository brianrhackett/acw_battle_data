The ABPP made significant changes to the 1993 Study Area. The area
south of the town of Calhoun where Federal forces deployed for
battle was added. The eastern and western edges of the Study Area
were redrawn to conform to the width of the valley, which was too
wide for Johnston to effectively cover. The untenable topography
dictated a military withdrawal, which Johnston executed. The
Confederate army moved to Cassville; the Federals pursued.

the valley, and the Western and Atlantic Railroad (now owned by
CSX) remains on its historic alignment. The original town of
Adairsville has disappeared (modern Adairsville lies several miles
south of the old town site). Development pressure along U.S.
Route 41 threatens the survival of the battlefield and the
archeological sites associated with the old town of Adairsville.
Historic integrity of the battlefield will likely deteriorate in the
next five years without immediate and coordinated protection
efforts. Local leadership could make a tremendous difference to
the fate of this Civil War battlefield.

Condition Statement

Although parts of the historic battlefield landscape were
inundated to form Allatoona Lake in 1950, the northern portion of
the battlefield retains integrity and is managed and interpreted as
a historic site by the Army Corps of Engineers, in cooperation with
the Etowah Valley Historical Society and the Red Top Mountain
State Park. Significant battlefield features—such as the Western
and Atlantic Railroad cut through Allatoona Pass, two wellpreserved earthen forts with extensive undisturbed trenches and
outerworks, an antebellum house, and the grave of an unknown
soldier—survive and are interpreted for the public. Creation of the
lake, recreational and marine uses associated with it, and
residential development has destroyed the integrity of the
southern portion of the Study Area.

The ABPP revised the 1993 Study Area and Core Area boundaries. A
Core Area was added to represent the primary fighting at Reynold’s
Plantation, a few miles north of Buck Head Creek. The Core Area
delineated in 1993 represented the fighting at the creek itself, a
tactically important holding action but one that was secondary to the
fight at Reynold’s Plantation. The ABPP expanded the northern
portion of the Study Area to include the new Core Area and to
represent the Federal withdrawal. Kilpatrick withdrew in order to put
distance between his force and the Confederate cavalry he believed
was in pursuit.

Condition Statement

The topography and historic setting of the battlefield are little
changed since the Civil War. The area remains a patchwork of pine
forests and scattered private farms. Today, timber harvesting is the
primary land use within the Study Area. Construction of new
logging roads and the use of heavy logging equipment may
damage archeological resources and cause soil erosion on fragile
historic landforms. If logging impacts on the battlefield can be
assessed and minimized, Buck Head Creek will remain one of the
best opportunities for comprehensive Civil War landscape
preservation in Georgia.

Condition Statement

Portions of the historic landscape at Chickamauga have been
altered since the Civil War, but most features and land essential to
the understanding of the battle remain. The battlefield lies in the
densely developed Chattanooga metropolitan area. The National
Park Service’s Chickamauga Battlefield unit of the Chickamauga
and Chattanooga National Military Park preserves approximately
75% of the area of fighting on September 19-20, 1863. Only about
20% of the area of fighting on September 18, 1863, however, is
preserved within the bounds of the National Military Park’s
Chickamauga Battlefield unit.
When originally envisioned by Civil War veterans, the Chickamauga
Battlefield unit was to be a 10,000 acre area from Rossville Gap on
the north to Glass's Mill on the south along the corridor of the
LaFayette Road and between Chickamauga Creek on the east and
the eastern hills of Missionary Ridge on the west. The original
authorization from Congress was for an area of 7,600 acres with
most of the reduction coming from the north and south end of the
area the veterans originally envisioned. The appropriation for the
purchase of the land, however, was insufficient to buy all of the
originally authorized 7,600 acres, leaving the Chickamauga
Battlefield unit at approximately 5,000 acres. Between the 1890s
when the battlefield unit was created and 1970, roughly 500 acres
were added to the unit.
Today, areas of the battlefield outside of the 5,509 acres owned by
the National Park Service are becoming more densely developed as
the Chattanooga region grows. Growth associated with the U.S.
Army post of Fort Oglethorpe has resulted in dense development
north and west of the park. Some agricultural and lightly
developed areas remain on the east, southeast, and southern sides
of the park, mostly in Catoosa County (one of the fastest growing
counties in Georgia) and the floodplain of Chickamauga Creek.
The density of development in those areas continues to increase.
At present, there are still opportunities to protect additional
historic lands through partnerships with the National Park Service,
the State, local governments, land trusts, and private landowners.

Condition Statement

The battlefield landscape is little changed since the Civil War.
McLemore's Cove (the valley located between Lookout Mountain
and Pigeon Mountain), Dug Gap, and Stephens Gap all retain a
high degree of historic integrity. Residential development in
McLemore’s Cove is beginning to fracture the landscape, however,
which is a serious long-term threat to the battlefield. Other
threats include the upgrades to State Route 193 and continuing
growth of industrial complexes in Kensington at the heart of the
battlefield’s Core Area. While Buck Head Creek and Griswoldville
also retain a high degree of landscape integrity, Davis’ Cross Roads
is the most immediately threatened. As such, it deserves to be
among the top battlefield preservation priorities in the state.
