Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance.
Morton’s Ford presents one of the best opportunities in Virginia
for preservation of an entire battlefield landscape. However, the
recent conversion of rural land to residential estates, and the
battlefield’s proximity to the growing town of Culpeper indicates
the need for assertive preservation efforts.
