Condition

Fisher’s Hill will continue to benefit from public-private protection
efforts, which have saved about five percent of the surviving
historic landscape. The planned widening of Interstate 81, if not
designed by preservation advocates and transportation planners
to avoid or minimize impacts, will destroy portions of the
battlefield landscape.
