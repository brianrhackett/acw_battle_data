Study Area

2,931.47 acres
The Study Area’s northern boundary was modified to conform with the
banks of the Big Black River. The ABPP added the Federal route of advance
from Edwards Depot, where troops camped after the battle of Champion
Hill and from where they moved on Big Black River Bridge the following
day. Additions also include the Confederate retreat route, which illustrates
the significance of this battle as a precursor to the events that would
unfold the following day in Vicksburg. The ABPP reduced the Core Area to
represent more accurately the range of the artillery employed during
battle.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The course of the Big Black River has shifted only
slightly since 1863. A number of the creeks and bayous that flow
into the Big Black River, along with accompanying swampland,
have changed little since the time of battle. Several swamps along
the approach route have been drained for use as farmland. Light
residential development on the approach and withdrawal routes
could increase over time, but the current condition offers good
opportunity for comprehensive preservation.

Study Area

3,237.80 acres
The ABPP revised the Study Area to incorporate the path of running
retreat used by Federal infantry and cavalry, as well as areas where
opposing cavalries skirmished. Additions also include the approach
route used by Confederate cavalry moving onto the battlefield and
locations on the east side of the Study Area where Confederate
cavalry deployed for battle. The ABPP removed part of the 1993 Study
Area along Pontotoc Road where fighting did not occur. The redrawn
Core Area more accurately represents the spread and range of artillery
fire.

Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance. Most of
the historic road network, including Brice's Cross Roads itself, is
intact. In addition to the Brice’s Cross Roads National Battle Site, a
state monument marking the location of the Brice House (no
longer extant) commemorates the battle. A modern church sits
near the site of the crossroad’s original church. The rolling terrain,
which characterized the landscape in 1864, retains integrity. Many
of the battlefield’s historic creeks, including Tishomingo and Dry
Creek, are unchanged. Today, there are far fewer trees at Brice's
Cross Roads than at the time of battle. Farmland has replaced tree
cover in large portions of the battlefield. Only light residential
and commercial development intrudes upon the landscape. The
greatest impending threat to this isolated, yet well marked,
battlefield is its vulnerability to archeological looting. Brice’s Cross
Roads is Mississippi’s greatest opportunity for comprehensive
battlefield preservation.

Study Area

13,696.80 acres
The ABPP enlarged the Study Area to include the Jackson, Raymond,
and Middle Roads from the point of Federal advance at dawn on May
16, 1863, to the location where forces converged on the main field of
battle. As the starting positions of troops moving into battle, the
Confederate bivouacs around Edwards Depot are also included. Both
Confederate retreat routes have been included within the revised
Study Area to illustrate how Pemberton’s army was splintered by the
battle (Loring’s Division moved south, while most of the other
Confederate forces moved west to their next line of defense at Big
Black River Bridge). The Core Area has been modified to include areas
of fighting on the west side of Baker’s Creek, heavy skirmishing north
of the Middle Road, and the locations of artillery placed around the
Champion House.

Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance. Most of
the historic roads that crossed the battlefield in 1863 are intact, as
are the approach routes. The modern rail line follows that of the
historic Vicksburg-Jackson Railroad. The ridge upon which
Confederate forces deployed, including Champion Hill, remains
rural. Baker's and Jackson Creek are unchanged since the time of
battle. The town of Edwards, formally called Edwards Depot,
grew significantly after the war and the abandoned railroad
facilities have deteriorated significantly. A large food production
and distribution center is located on the southern edge of the
Confederate battle line location, and a gravel pit located on the
eastern edge of the Core Area has destroyed a portion of the
battlefield. Residential development on the southern and
northern edges of the Study Area threatens to expand onto the
battlefield. Prompt action should be taken to protect the
landscape of a battle considered to be among the most significant
fought in Mississippi during the Civil War.

The ABPP added portions of the historic Mississippi River trace and the
historic Yazoo River trace to the Study Area to represent northern routes
used by US forces attempting to assault the Vicksburg defenses. The ABPP
also added locations of Confederate artillery on the Walnut Hills ridgeline.
The Core Area was reduced to include only the specific locations of Federal
assaults at Chickasaw Bayou, and the targets of the Federal naval
bombardment at Snyder’s Bluff.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. North of the City of Vicksburg, the Walnut Hills
remain as a defining feature of the battlefield. The Yazoo River,
its tributaries, and surrounding bayous also retain integrity.
Modern transportation routes – US Highway 61 and the Illinois
Central Railroad – pass through the battlefield’s Core Area and
have brought development north from Vicksburg. Housing, light
commercial development, and large-scale industry from the Port
of Vicksburg have damaged the battlefield terrain and viewshed
around the Walnut Hills. As the City of Vicksburg continues to
grow, the Confederate battery locations on the Walnut Hills will
face increasing threat. The heights, which are privately owned,
unprotected, and vulnerable, require immediate preservation.

Study Area

15,987.39 acres (Alcorn County, 15,403.16 acres; McNairy County,
TN, 584.23 acres)
The ABPP modified the 1993 Study Area boundary substantially. The
approach/withdrawal route between Hatchie’s Bridge, Tennessee, and
Chewalla, Tennessee, was excised (that movement is recognized by
the ABPP as Hatchie’s Bridge TN007). The Federal approach on the
Kossuth Road from the south was also removed; the ABPP could not
determine which modern road or road trace corresponds with the
historic route. The Confederate approach/withdrawal routes to the
northwest were added to incorporate associated skirmish locations.
The ABPP also extended the Study Area to include Federal approach
routes and associated skirmishing locations in the southeast, west,
and at the Tuscumbia River crossing over Smith Bridge. The ABPP
expanded the Core Area slightly in the south to include the Federal
line of battle from Whitfield House, and in the north to represent the
location of Confederate troop movements between the Chewalla
Road and the Memphis and Ohio Railroad.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered, but some essential
features remain. U.S. Highways 45 and 72 cut through the
southern and western portions of the battlefield, while a new rail
line, the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad, also passes through the city.
Residential and commercial development has destroyed the
southern and eastern portions of the Study Area. Corinth’s
historic downtown is still distinguishable. The modern Norfolk
Southern and Illinois Central Gulf railroads run along historic
routes and intersect in Corinth just as they did in 1862. Portions of
the historic road network remain, particularly in the northwest
portion of the battlefield where many of the historic creeks also
crisscross the landscape. Batteries manned by Federal forces
during the battle retain integrity (Battery F is in particularly
excellent condition), but the sprawl of development from the city
threatens to destroy unprotected battlefield lands.
