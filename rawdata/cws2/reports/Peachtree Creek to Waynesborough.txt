Union victory

Study Area

6,097.03 acres
The ABPP lengthened the Study Area to include the location where
Thomas’ army crossed the Chattahoochee River, emphasizing the
historic significance of Peachtree Creek as the first major clash
between the Union and Confederate forces after the collapse of the
Chattahoochee Line. The ABPP reduced the size of the 1993 Core
Area to better conform to the physical constraints of the landscape
and the documented area of fighting.

The revised Study Area includes routes used by the Federal army
group as they pursued the Army of Tennessee from Rocky Face
Ridge to Resaca. The main Core Area has been adjusted to conform
to the heights west of Camp Creek, initially the location of
Confederate defensive works and then Federal artillery. A second
Core Area to the south of Resaca represents the action and Federal
pontoon crossing at Lay’s Ferry, by which the 2nd Division
successfully gained the flank of the Confederate position and
encouraged Johnston to withdraw.

Condition Statement

Portions of the battlefield landscape have been altered—
particularly along Interstate 75 and US Route 41 as they cut
through the battlefield—but most essential historic features
remain. Extensive trench networks used by both Union and
Confederate forces survive on the high ground. Farmland, over
which most of the assaults took place, remains in agricultural
production. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources is
developing a new state historic site at Resaca, which is slated to
open in 2013. Another 3,500 acres can still be protected at Resaca
if national, state, and local partners work together with battlefield
landowners to preserve one of the least fractured Atlanta
Campaign battlefields.

Condition Statement

Much of the battlefield landscape has been altered, leaving some
essential battle features. Although Taylor Ridge, White Oak
Mountain, and the gap are still identifiable there are numerous
threats to this dwindling historic landscape. Industrial
development along Depot Street and the potential widening of US
Route 41 may further damage the battlefield. The most significant

While the center of the battlefield along the ridge retains
integrity, a great deal of the Study Area has been compromised by
modern development. Development pressure continues to
threaten the battlefield as large subdivisions and custom homes
are being built north and west of Interstate 75. With immediate
and concerted effort, Federal, state, and local partners could
double the amount of protected land at Rocky Face Ridge within
the next ten years.
