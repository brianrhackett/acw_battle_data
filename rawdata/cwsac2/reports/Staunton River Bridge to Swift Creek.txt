Condition Statement

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Fort Huger sits unprotected on prime river
front land. The potential development of the eastern bank of
the Nansemond River and the northern bank of the Western
Branch of the Nansemond will likely alter the best remaining
battlefield landscape in Suffolk.
