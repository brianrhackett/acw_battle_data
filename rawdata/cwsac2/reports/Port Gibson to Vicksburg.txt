Study Area

7,959.41 acres
The ABPP expanded the Study Area to include the route of Federal
advance from their landing at Bruinsburg and the Confederate retreat
routes across Bayou Pierre where Federal pursuit ended. The
Bruinsburg route is included for its significance as the opening
movement of the campaign on the Mississippi side of the river, and
because additional Federal troops arrived by this route throughout
the day. The Study Area was also enlarged to include the historic
boundaries of the Buck Creek and Bayou Pierre waterways – obstacles
that dictated troop movements during the battle.
The ABPP expanded the Core Area in the north to include the
Confederate lines and sweeping Federal assault and in the south to
include the location of fighting around Magnolia Church.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The Mississippi River has shifted significantly
since 1863. The riverbank’s westward movement has led to the
desertion of the town of Bruinsburg. The ridge along Centers
Creek has been destroyed. Although the town of Port Gibson has
been altered significantly by modern development, the historic
road network within the town and to the west retains integrity.
James and Widows Creeks, and Bayou Pierre are unchanged since
the time of battle, and the surrounding landscape of thick
undergrowth and deep crevasses is little changed. As a nationally
significant landscape, Port Gibson should be the focus of
considerable preservation efforts. To retain cohesion as a wellpreserved, interpretable landscape, the battlefield will need
protection from the development expanding westward from the
city.

The ABPP redrew Raymond’s Study Area to better represent the full
extent of the battlefield and associated troop movements. Corridors
and locations used by combatants to move from the Core Area to
support areas were added, including the Federal approach route from
the south and the Confederate route of withdrawal and encampment
in the northeast. The ABPP reduced the battlefield Core Area to
remove locations where fighting is unconfirmed by primary sources.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The Fourteenmile Creek is still identifiable as the
position used by counter-attacking Confederates. The Federal
position along Artillery Ridge, portions of the historic Utica Road,
and some of the historic road network in Raymond also retains
integrity. Raymond has grown significantly since the time of the
battle, and commercial development expanding from the city
along State Route 18 threatens the northern portion of the Study
Area. This road, which follows a portion of the old Utica Road
trace, bisects the battlefield. The Illinois Central Gulf Railroad,
which was not present at the time of battle, cuts through the
western edge of the Study Area. The expansion of a horticultural
garden on Artillery Ridge and the campus of a junior college on
the northern edge of the Core Area could threaten the historic
battlefield landscape. The Core Area, which retains good
integrity, should be the focus of preservation efforts at Raymond
within the next five years.

Hardin County, TN, 638.74 acres)
The CWSAC did not establish Study and Core Area boundaries for the
Siege of Corinth in 1993. For this study, the ABPP determined new
boundaries for the complex siege operations.
The historic Memphis and Charlestown Railroad serves as the western
edge of the Study Area, while the valley of Sevenmile Creek
represents the eastern boundary. The heights surrounding Corinth in
the north, which were dominated by Confederate earthworks, and
the heights surrounding Corinth in the east, which were used by both
Confederate and Federal forces, are included. The ABPP included the
multiple converging Federal advance routes from Tennessee to
illustrate the importance of Corinth as a regional military objective.
The Mobile and Ohio Railroad, used as the Confederate retreat route,
was included for its significance as the most direct avenue of escape
from Corinth to the south.
A large Core Area near Farmington represents the Confederate attack
on the isolated Federal Army of the Mississippi on May 9th. The
wedge-shaped Core Area represents the Federal bombardment of
Corinth and its defenses on May 28th. The northernmost Core Area
represents the location of most intense fighting as the Federal Army
of the Tennessee advanced down the Purdy Road on May 22. The
Core Areas along Phillips and Bridge creeks represent several intense
skirmishes, particularly in the area of the Surrett House (May 21-28).

Condition Statement

Large portions of the landscape have been altered, but many
essential features remain. U.S. Highways 45 and 72 cut through
the southern and western portions of the battlefield, while a new
rail line, the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad, also passes through the
city. Industrial complexes east of the city (below the heights used
by US forces to bombard Corinth and within the Farmington Core
Area) have destroyed significant portions of the battlefield. Rapid
residential development, especially along Bridge Creek and
eastward toward Farmington, has destroyed large sections of
earthworks, but a significant number of earthworks to the north
and east of the city survive. The creeks that slowed the pace of US
forces advancing from the east are unchanged since the battle,
and much of Corinth’s historic downtown is intact. The modern
Norfolk Southern and Illinois Central Gulf railroads run alongside
historic routes and still intersect in Corinth as they did in 1862.
Portions of the historic road network remain, particularly along
the Federal approach routes in the northeast. However,
additional residential and commercial development sprawling
from the city threatens unprotected battlefield land. If left
unchecked, further fragmentation will completely destroy the
integrity of the siege landscape.

of the Confederate line. The Core Area adjustments reflect the range
and sweep of the guns employed by Confederate defenders and the
Federal Navy. The revised Core Area also includes the positions of
Confederate batteries that fired down the Yazoo River at the Federal

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. Snyder's Bluff and the Walnut Hills
remain dominant topographical features, but US Highway 61, a
modern highway, runs through the Study Area at the base of the
Walnut Hills to connect Vicksburg with the community of
Redwood. Just beyond Redwood, a new bridge over the Yazoo
River significantly alters the historic viewshed. Although
construction of this bridge has caused extensive erosion along the
riverbank, much of the Yazoo River, tributaries, and surrounding
swamp between the Walnut Hills and Yazoo River retains
integrity. Most of the Confederate battery positions on the
Walnut Hills are no longer intact, but the opportunity for
preservation of the greater battlefield landscape remains feasible
if undertaken with haste. Development pressures from Vicksburg
threaten to advance north along US Route 61 toward what
remains of the intact landscape at Snyder’s Bluff battlefield.

includes the western approach route used by Confederates
responding to news of Federal activity in Tupelo, as well as the route
taken by withdrawing Federal forces, which connects the prime Core
Area in the south with the secondary, northern Core Area. The ABPP
redrew the southern Core Area to include only locations of fighting
confirmed by primary source documentation, and added a new Core
Area in the north where fighting occurred at Old Town Creek.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered, leaving some essential
features. Extensive development around the city has flattened or
covered many of the battlefield’s defining features, particularly
those associated with the main battle line. Only the railroad and
Kings Creek remain intact in the main battlefield area, while,
north of the city, Town Creek and the surrounding heights retain
integrity. Currently, residential subdivisions near Town Creek
threaten what little remains of the Tupelo battlefield. Additional
development in the Town Creek area will lead to complete
destruction of the landscape. Preservation efforts should focus on
immediate protection of the Old Town Creek Core Area,
associated viewsheds, and setting.

north toward and around De Soto Point, and south beyond Grant’s
Canal. Revisions also include addition of the Yazoo River north to
Snyder’s Bluff, and the location of a Federal supply depot and its
accompanying fortifications. Expansion of the Study Area around the
City of Vicksburg includes the Confederate fortifications across from
Grant’s Canal in the south, and fortifications north of the city on
Walnut Bluff.
The Core Areas representing locations of Federal land assaults on May
19 and May 22 were expanded slightly to include the approach route
of Federal forces toward the Railroad Redoubt. Core Areas associated
with riverside fortifications were expanded greatly to include areas of
artillery fire between the Federal Navy land batteries on Desoto Point
and Confederate batteries below Vicksburg. The ABPP added new
Core Areas at the Marine Hospital battery, Walnut Bluff fortifications,
and along the heights south of the city, to represent locations of
fighting between the Federal Navy and Confederate land batteries.
Finally, a Core Area was added on Desoto Point to include the location
of the Federal Army batteries that fired from the point into the city.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered, leaving some essential
features. The City of Vicksburg has grown well beyond its historic
boundaries, but its hilltop position still gives visitors a good
impression of the massive undertaking that would have been
required to besiege the city in 1863. Aside from resources
protected within the boundaries of Vicksburg National Military
Park and Vicksburg National Cemetery, the only battlefield
features that retain integrity are the Walnut Hills (northeast of the
city) and a portion of the Yazoo River (north of the city). Future
preservation efforts should focus on these areas.
The Confederate and Federal trench networks around Vicksburg,
along with the vast majority of earthworks in Vicksburg National
Military Park, are reconstructions built by the Civilian Conservation
Corps during the 1930s. Residential and commercial development
threatens trenches south of the city where most of the historic
battlefield has already been lost. Shifting riverbanks and heavy
industrial development along the Mississippi River (south of the
city) and the Yazoo River Diversion Canal (west of the city) have
destroyed most of the historic waterfront.
