National Trust for Historic Preservation (1964), the Shenandoah
Valley Battlefields Foundation (2000), and Shenandoah County

Condition Statement

Despite remarkable partnership efforts to protect this
nationally-significant landscape, more than 10,000 acres remain
at risk. Commercial, residential, and industrial development—
including the expansion of a limestone quarry on the battlefield,
the proposed widening of Interstate 81, and the proposed
construction of a new 500kv transmission line—all illustrate the
need for continued and strenuous protection of the Cedar Creek
battlefield.

Condition Statement

This battlefield is at its tipping point. Because views across this
rural landscape allow a sweeping understanding of the battle,
any modern construction becomes a jarring intrusion on the
historic scene. Large parcels are being subdivided, and housing

comprehensive landscape preservation today, but the
opportunity is likely to fade within the next five years.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Chaffin’s Farm/New Market Heights offers
opportunities for additional land preservation beyond federal
and county-owned lands. Growing development pressure
signals the need for preservation within the next three to five
years.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented,
leaving some essential features. Despite local, state, and
national efforts to protect this premier battlefield, half of
Chancellorsville’s Study Area has been lost to development.
Protection efforts need to be redoubled to save remaining
historic lands and resources.
