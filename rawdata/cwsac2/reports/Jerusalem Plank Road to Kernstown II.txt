Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented,
leaving some essential features. About 35 percent of the
surviving historic landscape is already protected. Given
accelerating land development in the area, the chance to
preserve the battlefield’s remaining 1,100 acres may vanish
within the next five years. The planned widening of Interstate 81,
if not designed by preservation advocates and transportation
planners to avoid or minimize impacts, will destroy portions of the
battlefield landscape.
