Update to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation’s Civil War Battlefields
Final DRAFT -- State of Louisiana

59

Condition Statement

Most of the historic landscape retains a high degree of integrity,
but is severely threatened by lignite mining operations. Mining
has already decimated the southeastern portion of the Core Area
and threatens to destroy the land over which the final fighting of
the day occurred. Clear-cut timbering and scattered residential
construction are secondary threats to the battlefield. The ABPP
considers Mansfield, scene of the decisive battle of the Red River
Campaign, the highest priority for protection in Louisiana.
Immediate federal, state, and local efforts are needed to preserve
this battlefield.

Results

Union victory

Study Area

7,402.21 acres
The revised Study Area includes the route of the Federal advance
from Marksville and deployment across the level plain north of
Moreauville. It also includes the route taken by Confederate forces
retreating toward Hessmer, a movement that allowed MG Banks to
continue his march east and provided MG Taylor with the
opportunity to strike at the Federal wagon trains. The Core Area
was enlarged slightly at the southwest corner to include previously
unmapped Confederate artillery positions.

Update to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation’s Civil War Battlefields
Final DRAFT -- State of Louisiana

62

Condition Statement

A substantial portion of the Core Area retains integrity, but is
being pressured by rapid development associated with a new
casino just south of Marksville, heavy residential development
along State Routes 114 and 115 west of Mansura, and industrial
development south of the airport along State Route 1. Like
Mansfield and Pleasant Hill, this Red River Campaign site is a high
priority for protection. Immediate federal, state, and local efforts
are needed to preserve this battlefield.

Study Area

17,395.21 acres (9,750.38 acres in Louisiana; 7,644.83 acres in
Mississippi)
The Study Area was revised to include the African Brigade and 10th Illinois
Cavalry’s route of reconnaisance toward and retirement from Tullulah.
Also included in the revision is the historic trace of the Mississippi River,

Update to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation’s Civil War Battlefields
Final DRAFT -- State of Louisiana

65

Condition Statement

Much of the historic landscape has been altered and fragmented,
leaving some essential features. The open, agricultural landscape
has remained much as it was during the time of battle, but the
Mississippi River has dramatically changed its course since the Civil
War. The river’s movements washed over portions of the
battlefield and altered their appearance, topographical
relationships, and sense of location. In addition, the Mississippi
River levee detracts from the battlefield’s integrity. The portion of
the battlefield that retains integrity is not under development
pressure at this time, and should be seen as a long-term
preservation opportunity

Results

Union victory

Study Area

7,293.24 acres
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area in three places: northwest to
the Federal camps in Cloutierville from which the Federals marched on
the morning of April 23 under pressure from the Confederates; southeast
along the Federal route of advance towards Alexandria after Banks’s
forces had broken through Bee’s cavalry; and in the location of the
Federal flanking movement over the upper ford of the Cane River. The
Core Area was extended to include the full range of fire delivered by
Confederate and Union artillery pieces and the Federal cavalry
engagement northeast of the main action.

Condition Statement

Monett’s Ferry battlefield retains good integrity despite the
presence of several modern intrusions: the I-49 interchange at
Chopin, the adjacent plywood manufacturing plant, and scattered
residential construction. Development pressure, while not
immediate, is steady and accelerating. This Red River Campaign
battlefield presents an excellent opportunity for comprehensive
battlefield protection.

Historical Designation

While Monett’s Ferry battlefield has not been recognized
individually, it does lie within the boundaries of the Cane River
National Heritage Area.

New Orleans (LA002)
Location

St. Bernard Parish; Orleans Parish; Plaquemines Parish; Jefferson Parish

Campaign

Expedition to and capture of New Orleans (1862)

Battle Date(s)

April 25 - May 1, 1862

Principal Commanders

Flag Officer David G. Farragut, Major General Benjamin F. Butler [US];
Major General Mansfield Lovell [CS]

Forces Engaged

West Gulf Blockading Squadron and the Department of the Gulf [US];
New Orleans garrison [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

24,610.77 acres
The ABPP extended the Study Area to Quarantine Point on the
Mississippi River, where Farragut rallied his squadron after the
battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and then steamed toward the
City of New Orleans. The boundary also indicates the route taken by
retreating Confederate defenders toward Camp Moore north of the
city. The 1993 Core Area around the historic district of New Orleans
was removed as there was no documented fighting in this location.
The ABPP added two new Core Areas along Farragut's approach
route to illustrate the locations of artillery duels between
Confederate defenders and the Federal Navy.

71

Condition Statement

The landscape and terrain of the battlefield have been altered
beyond recognition since the time of battle. As a landscape, this
battlefield no longer retains integrity. However, several structures
associated with the battle and the surrender of the city survive
with good integrity as individual resources. These include Gallier
Hall, the old United States Mint, the Customs House, Confederate
forts Pike and Macomb, Battery Bienvenue, and the historic Vieux
Carré itself. Preservation opportunities are limited to maintaining
and restoring the surviving structures, particularly the masonry
fortifications.
