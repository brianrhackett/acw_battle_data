Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented,
leaving some essential features. The planned widening of
Interstate 81, if not designed by preservation advocates and
transportation planners to avoid or minimize impacts, will
destroy areas of the battlefield landscape. The Core Area at
Stephenson’s Depot remains the last substantial piece of intact
land within the battlefield.
