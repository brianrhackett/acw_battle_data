Infantry regiments (p. 3)

> The following table will show clearly the relative position of the leading infantry regiments in point of numerical loss. It embraces every infantry regiment in the Union Armies which lost over 200 men, killed or mortally wounded in action, during the war. In all, there are forty-five:
> This statement does not include the Heavy Artillery, which, owing to their larger form of organization, will be considered separately from the ordinary regiments of the line.


Heavy Artillery Regiment losses. p. 3

> The following list embraces all the heavy artillery regiments in which the number of killed, or died of wounds, exceeded two hundred:

Cavalry regiments

> A cavalry regiment numbered 1200 men, nominally, and was divided into twelve companies of one hundred each. They did not suffer such severe losses in particular engagements as did the infantry, but their losses were divided among a great many more battles. The cavalry went into action very much oftener than infantry. Although mounted and armed with sabres, much of their fighting was done dismounted, and with carbines. The mounted regiments which lost the most men, killed or fatally wounded in action, were the following:


# battery losses

> In some cases there were regimental organizations comprising 12 batteries, but most of the troops in this arm of the service were independent commands; even where there was a regimental organization, each battery acted separately and independently of the others. In the volunteer service the leading batteries, in point of loss in battle, were as follows:

Regimental percentages of killed during entire term of service

> Most regiments served under more than one division commander, and some of them in more than one corps for lack of space, mention is made here only of the division which will best assist the reader in identifying the regiment and its campaigns.



> In some of the regiments of the preceding list, a part of the enrollment has been omitted, and the percentage was calculated on the number enrolled during the period of active service. In some cases deduction was made for large bodies of conscripts which never joined the regiment, although their names were borne upon the rolls; also, for accessions of substitutes and drafted men who did not reach the regiment until the fighting had practically ended. Partial enrollments were used in calculating the percentages of the Second Massachusetts, Third Wisconsin, Twentieth Massachusetts, Seventh West Virginia, Eighty-second New York, and Eighty-third New York.

> There were many regiments which would appear in the preceding table of high percentages were it not that their rolls were unduly swelled by useless names; by conscripts and mercenaries
> who deserted on their way to the front; and by transfers from disbanded regiments, in which too large a number of the men appeared on the transfer papers only. An attempt has been made in the succeeding pages to render justice to such regiments by tabulating the original enrollment separately, and stating the percentage of killed as based on that. In the Fifth New Hampshire, which does not appear in the table of high percentages, 17.9 per cent. of the original regiment were killed or mortally wounded.
> Care was necessary, also, to avoid counting names twice, as in many regiments men were transferred from one company to another, their names appearing on the muster-out rolls of each company. In the printed rolls of the New Jersey troops these men are counted twice in the recapitulation which appears at the end of each regimental roll, thereby increasing, apparently, the quota of men furnished, but lowering the percentage of killed. Still, the printed rolls of the New Jersey regiments are in better shape than those of any other State, and are highly creditable to the authorities who had charge of the publication. In the regimental rolls published by Massachusetts, the names of those who reenlisted appear twice; and in all the State rolls names are duplicated more or less as the result of transfers or consolidation of companies. On the War Department records, a man who reenlisted was counted as two men, and so credited on the quota of the State.

> In the figures given here, pains have been taken to avoid counting a man more than once, the intention being that the total enrollment should show exactly the number of individuals who served in each regiment.


# max_regiments_killed_in_battle.tsv

p. 17. Maximum of regimental loss in killed and died of wounds in particular engagements.

While losses of regiments show killed, wounded, and missing.
The list of maximum regimental losses in battles includes only the killed, including the mortally wounded.

> The surviving wounded and the missing are omitted in the following list, in order to emphasize the more important feature of the loss, and the consequent relative position of the various regiments in this respect. The losses of the different commands can be compared better by eliminating the somewhat indefinite factor of the wounded and missing, and tabulating the regiments with regard only to the killed and died of wounds.

> This list has been prepared after a careful examination of the muster-out rolls of every regiment whose losses would indicate that they might possibly have a place in this column. In each case the rolls have been examined name by name, in order to count the ones recorded there as killed or mortally wounded in the battles mentioned. The list includes every regiment in the Union Armies which sustained, in any one battle, a loss in killed or mortally wounded of fifty or more.

# proportion_of_wounded_to_killed

p. 23. proportion of wounded to killed in various battles

> In these figures the mortally wounded are included with the killed, as the object is to state clearly the loss of life in each instance instead of the total casualties. The proportion of the wounded to the number killed or died of wounds is very near 2.5. This ratio is based on the figures, after the mortally wounded have been deducted from the wounded and added to the killed.

> This ratio of 2.5 must not be confounded with the one representing the usual proportion of wounded to killed, as shown in statements of aggregate losses in battle. In such losses the proportion of wounded to the killed is about 4.8, the mortally wounded being always included with the wounded; for the casualty lists are made up at the close of the battle, and with the killed are included only those who died on the field. In all such statements — of killed, wounded, and missing — the mortally wounded are necessarily included with the wounded, and the word killed refers only to those who were killed outright, or died within a few hours.

> The proportion of 4.8 is an average ratio as regards the aggregate of losses in battle, but is not a constant one. It varies somewhat, the proportion of killed increasing where the fighting is close and destructive, while in long range fighting the proportion of wounded increases.

> Included in the “Captured and missing” are many wounded men, also a large number of killed. Their relative proportion cannot be ascertained, but it probably would not differ enough from the usual ratio to change the average to any extent. In the preceding table the losses at Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Chickamauga, and Drewry's Bluff are omitted.
> In those battles the Union Armies lost possession of the field, and consequently a large number of the killed are included with the missing — so large a number that any ratio based on the casualties of these battles would be misleading.

1. "total deaths. Troops furnished; three years standard": Number left after deducting sailors, colored troops, and commutations, the deaths credited here to each State having occurred wholly in the white troops. The loss in the colored troops is itemized here by itself. For the number of colored soldiers furnished by each State, see Table “D.”

2 cell "Colored Troops", "total deaths. Troops furnished; three years standard": Not including loss in the three Massachusetts colored regiments, which were organized and officered exclusively by that State; their enrollment and loss is included with that of the white troops from Massachusetts.

3 row "Veteran Reserves": "The number of men in the Regular Army was about 67,000; in the Veteran Reserve Corps, 60,508; Hancock's Veteran Corps, 10,833; United States Sharpshooters (Berdan's two regiments), 2,570; other organizations of white volunteers, about 8,500. All these (except about 20,000 Regulars who were in service at the outbreak of the war) are included in the number of men furnished by the various States, but the exact share furnished by each State is not known. For this reason, the actual percentage of loss by each State is somewhat larger than the apparent one.
