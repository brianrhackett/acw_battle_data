1. "total deaths. Troops furnished; three years standard": Number left after deducting sailors, colored troops, and commutations, the deaths credited here to each State having occurred wholly in the white troops. The loss in the colored troops is itemized here by itself. For the number of colored soldiers furnished by each State, see Table “D.”

2 cell "Colored Troops", "total deaths. Troops furnished; three years standard": Not including loss in the three Massachusetts colored regiments, which were organized and officered exclusively by that State; their enrollment and loss is included with that of the white troops from Massachusetts.

3 row "Veteran Reserves": "The number of men in the Regular Army was about 67,000; in the Veteran Reserve Corps, 60,508; Hancock's Veteran Corps, 10,833; United States Sharpshooters (Berdan's two regiments), 2,570; other organizations of white volunteers, about 8,500. All these (except about 20,000 Regulars who were in service at the outbreak of the war) are included in the number of men furnished by the various States, but the exact share furnished by each State is not known. For this reason, the actual percentage of loss by each State is somewhat larger than the apparent one.

4 row "Hancock's Reserves": The number of men in the Regular Army was about 67,000; in the Veteran Reserve Corps, 60,508; Hancock's Veteran Corps, 10,833; United States Sharpshooters (Berdan's two regiments), 2,570; other organizations of white volunteers, about 8,500. All these (except about 20,000 Regulars who were in service at the outbreak of the war) are included in the number of men furnished by the various States, but the exact share furnished by each State is not known. For this reason, the actual percentage of loss by each State is somewhat larger than the apparent one.

All these (except about 20,000 Regulars who were in service at the outbreak of the war) are included in the number of men furnished by the various States, but the exact share furnished by each State is not known. For this reason, the actual percentage of loss by each State is somewhat larger than the apparent one.
