  "description": "To distract attention from a planned cavalry-infantry raid up the Peninsula on Richmond, the Federal army forced several crossings of the Rapidan River on February 6. A II Corps division crossed at Morton's Ford, the I Corps at Raccoon Ford. Union cavalry crossed at Robertson's Ford. Ewell's Corps resisted the crossings. Fighting was sporadic but most severe at Morton's Ford. By February 7, the attacks had stalled, and the Federals withdrew during the night.",
