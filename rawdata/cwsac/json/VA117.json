Richard Anderson (Army of Northern Virginia, I Corps) were sent from Petersburg to reinforce Early's army in the Valley. At Front Royal on the August 16, Union cavalry of Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's division surprised the Confederate columns in mid-stream of the Shenandoah River, capturing about 300. The Confederates rallied and advanced, gradually driving the two Union brigades back to Cedarville. After dark, Merritt withdrew to Ninevah.",
