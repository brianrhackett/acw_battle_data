<P><b>Description:</b> By April 1864, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks’s Red River

Expedition had advanced about 150 miles up Red River. Maj. Gen. Richard

Taylor, commander of the Confederate forces in the area, decided, without

any instructions from his commander Gen. E. Kirby Smith, that it was time

to try and stem this Union drive. Taylor gained a victory at Mansfield

on April 8. Banks withdrew from that battlefield to Pleasant Hill, but

he knew that fighting would resume the next day. Early on the 9th, Taylor’s

reinforced forces marched toward Pleasant Hill in the hopes of finishing

the destruction of the Union force. Although outnumbered, Taylor felt that

the Union army would be timid after Mansfield and that an audacious, well-coordinated

attack would be successful. The Confederates closed up, rested for a few

hours, and then attacked at 5:00 pm. Taylor planned to send a force to

assail the Union front while he rolled up the left flank and moved his

cavalry around the right flank to cut the escape route. The attack on the

Union left flank, under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Churchill,

succeeded in sending those enemy troops fleeing for safety. Churchill ordered

his men ahead, intending to attack the Union center from the rear. Union

troops, however, discerned the danger and hit Churchill’s right flank,

forcing a retreat.&nbsp; Pleasant Hill was the last major battle, in terms

of numbers of men involved, of the Louisiana phase of the Red River Campaign.

Although Banks won this battle, he retreated, wishing to get his army out

of west Louisiana before any greater calamity occurred. The battles of

Mansfield and Pleasant Hill jointly (although the former was much more

decisive) influenced Banks to forget his objective of capturing Shreveport.
