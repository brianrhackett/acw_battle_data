<P><b>Other Names:</b> Logan’s Cross-Roads, Fishing Creek

<p><b>Location:</b> Pulaski County and Wayne County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Offensive in Eastern Kentucky (1862)

<p><b>Date(s):</b> January 19, 1862

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Brig. Gen. George H. Thomas [US]; Maj. Gen. George

B. Crittenden [CS]
<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> 1st Division, Army of the Ohio, and Brig. Gen. A. Schoepf’s

Brigade (total of four brigades) [US]; division of two brigades [CS]



<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 671 total (US 232; CS 439)


<P><b>Description:</b> Although Brig. Gen. Felix K. Zollicoffer’s main responsibility

was to guard Cumberland Gap, in November 1861 he advanced west into Kentucky

to strengthen control in the area around Somerset. He found a strong defensive

position at Mill Springs and decided to make it his winter quarters. He

fortified the area, especially both sides of the Cumberland River. Union

Brig. Gen. George Thomas received orders to drive the Rebels across the

Cumberland River and break up Maj. Gen. George B. Crittenden’s army. He

left Lebanon and slowly marched through rain-soaked country, arriving at

Logan’s Crossroads on January 17, where he waited for Brig. Gen. A. Schoepf’s

troops from Somerset to join him. Maj. Gen. George Crittenden, Zollicoffer’s

superior, had arrived at Mill Springs and taken command of the Confederate

troops. He knew that Thomas was in the vicinity and decided that his best

defense was to attack the Yankees. The Rebels attacked Thomas at Logan’s

Crossroads at dawn on January 19. Unbeknownst to the Confederates, some

of Schoepf’s troops had arrived and reinforced the Union force. Initially,

the Rebel attack forced the first unit it hit to retire, but stiff resistance

followed and Zollicoffer was killed. The Rebels made another attack but

were repulsed. Union counterattacks on the Confederate right and left were

successful, forcing them from the field in a retreat that ended in Murfreesboro,

Tennessee. Mill Springs, along with Middle Creek, broke whatever Confederate

strength there was in eastern Kentucky. Confederate fortunes did not rise

again until summer when Gen. Braxton Bragg launched his offensive into

Kentucky. Mill Springs was the larger of the two Union Kentucky victories

in January 1862. With these victories, the Federals carried the war into

Middle Tennessee in February.
