<P><b>Description:</b> From Vicksburg, Mississippi, Sherman launched a campaign

to take the important railroad center at Meridian, Mississippi, and if

the situation were favorable, to push on to Selma, Alabama, and threaten

Mobile. Sherman ordered Brig. Gen. William Sooy Smith to lead a cavalry

force of 7,000 men from Memphis, Tennessee, on February 1, 1864, south

through Okolona, along the Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad, and to meet the

rest of the Union force at Meridian, on February 10. With the main force

of approximately 20,000 men, Sherman set out on the 3rd for Meridian, but

made feints on various other locations. Against orders, Smith delayed ten

days, while waiting for reinforcements, and did not start out until February

11. Destroying crops and railroad track along the way, Smith’s force met

almost no opposition, and, before long, 1,000 former slaves were traveling

with them. Smith was supposed to rendezvous with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman

at Meridian on the 10th, but he never arrived there. Sherman left Meridian

on the 20th, due in part to apprehension over Smith’s whereabouts. Smith

neared West Point, 90 miles north of Meridian, on the 20th, and he fought

with Confederate cavalry units at Prairie Station and Aberdeen. Smith—knowing

that Nathan Bedford Forrest commanded the troops he was fighting, concerned

about the fate of the former slaves with him, and not knowing how many

of the enemy he faced—decided to concentrate at Prairie Station, and, on

the morning of the 21st, he set out for West Point.&nbsp; Shortly after

dawn on the 21st, Col. Jeffrey Forrest’s Confederate cavalry brigade engaged

Smith. Withdrawing at times, Forrest drew Smith into a swamp west of the

Tombigbee River. Other Rebel troops arrived and the fighting intensified.

Smith was sure that this was a trap set for him, and, discerning that he

was greatly outnumbered, he ordered a retreat, leaving a rearguard. The

rearguard held off the Confederates for about two hours before withdrawing

in good order. About the same time, Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest arrived

and ordered a pursuit. Skirmishing occurred the rest of the day. At sunup

on the 22nd, the Rebels attacked Smith just south of Okolona on the prairie.

More Confederate troops arrived, causing breaks in the Union battle line,

precipitating a retreat. For most of the rest of the day, they engaged

in a running battle for a distance of eleven miles, with both sides attacking

and counterattacking. Col. Forrest was killed during one Rebel charge.

The Yankees finally broke off the fighting and headed for Pontotoc. Maj.

Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, the commander on the field, realized that

his men were nearly out of ammunition and did not order a pursuit. Mississippi

militia harassed Smith to the state line. Smith arrived in Collierville,

Tennessee, near Memphis, on the 26th. Although Smith had caused much destruction

during his expedition, Okolona forced him to retire before he could do

more. Smith’s actions against Sherman’s orders jeopardized the Meridian

Expedition.
