<P><b>Other Names:</b> None

<P><b>Location:</b> Catoosa County and Walker County

<P><b>Campaign:</b> Chickamauga Campaign (1863)

<P><b>Date(s):</b> September 18-20, 1863

<P><b>Principal Commanders:</b>  Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans and Maj. Gen. George
H. Thomas [US]; Gen. Braxton Bragg and Lt. Gen. James Longstreet [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> The Army of the Cumberland [US]; Army of Tennessee [CS]


<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 34,624 total (US 16,170; CS 18,454)
<P><b>Description:</b> After the Tullahoma Campaign, Rosecrans renewed his offensive,
aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga. The three army corps
comprising Rosecrans’ s army split and set out for Chattanooga by separate
routes. In early September, Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered
in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg’s army out of Chattanooga, heading
south. The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at Davis’ Cross
Roads. Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet
a part of Rosecrans’s army, defeat them, and then move back into the city.
On the 17th he headed north, intending to meet and beat the XXI Army Corps.
As Bragg marched north on the 18th, his cavalry and infantry fought with
Union cavalry and mounted infantry which were armed with Spencer repeating
rifles. Fighting began in earnest on the morning of the 19th, and Bragg’s
men hammered but did not break the Union line. The next day, Bragg continued
his assault on the Union line on the left, and in late morning, Rosecrans
was informed that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore up
the supposed gap, Rosencrans created one, and James Longstreet’s men promptly
exploited it, driving one-third of the Union army, including Rosecrans
himself, from the field. George H. Thomas took over command and began consolidating
forces on Horseshoe Ridge and Snodgrass Hill. Although the Rebels launched
determined assaults on these forces, they held until after dark. Thomas
then led these men from the field leaving it to the Confederates. The Union
retired to Chattanooga while the Rebels occupied the surrounding heights.
