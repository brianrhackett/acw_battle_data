<P><b>Other Names:</b> Murfreesboro

<p><b>Location:</b> Rutherford County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Stones River Campaign (1862-63)
<p><b>Date(s):</b> December 31, 1862-January 2, 1863

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans [US]; Gen. Braxton
Bragg [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Army of the Cumberland [US]; Army of Tennessee [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 23,515 total (US 13,249; CS 10,266)

<P><b>Description:</b> After Gen. Braxton Bragg’s defeat at Perryville, Kentucky,
October 8, 1862, he and his Confederate Army of the Mississippi retreated,
reorganized, and were redesignated as the Army of Tennessee. They then
advanced to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and prepared to go into winter quarters.&nbsp;
Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans’s Union Army of the Cumberland followed
Bragg from Kentucky to Nashville. Rosecrans left Nashville on December
26, with about 44,000 men, to defeat Bragg’s army of more than 37,000.&nbsp;
He found Bragg’s army on December 29 and went into camp that night, within
hearing distance of the Rebels. At dawn on the 31st, Bragg’s men attacked
the Union right flank. The Confederates had driven the Union line back
to the Nashville Pike by 10:00 am but there it held. Union reinforcements
arrived from Rosecrans’s left in the late forenoon to bolster the stand,
and before fighting stopped that day the Federals had established a new,
strong line. On New Years Day, both armies marked time. Bragg surmised
that Rosecrans would now withdraw, but the next morning he was still in
position. In late afternoon, Bragg hurled a division at a Union division
that, on January 1, had crossed Stones River and had taken up a strong
position on the bluff east of the river. The Confederates drove most of
the Federals back across McFadden’s Ford, but with the assistance of artillery,
the Federals repulsed the attack, compelling the Rebels to retire to their
original position. Bragg left the field on the January 4-5, retreating
to Shelbyville and Tullahoma, Tennessee. Rosecrans did not pursue, but
as the Confederates retired, he claimed the victory. Stones River boosted
Union morale.&nbsp; The Confederates had been thrown back in the east,
west, and in the Trans-Mississippi.
<P><b>Result(s):</b> Union victory
