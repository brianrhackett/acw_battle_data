<P><b>Other Names:</b> None

<p><b>Location:</b> Floyd County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Offensive in Eastern Kentucky (1862)


<p><b>Date(s):</b> January 10, 1862

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Col. James Garfield [US]; Brig. Gen. Humphrey

Marshall [CS]
<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> 18th Brigade [US]; brigade [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 92 total (US 27; CS 65)

<P><b>Description:</b> More than a month after Confederate Col. John S. Williams

left Kentucky, following the fight at Ivy Mountain, Brig. Gen. Humphrey

Marshall led another force into southeast Kentucky to continue recruiting

activities. From his headquarters in Paintsville, on the Big Sandy River,

northwest of Prestonsburg, Marshall recruited volunteers and had a force

of more than 2,000 men by early January, but could only partially equip

them. Union Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell directed Col. James Garfield to

force Marshall to retreat back into Virginia. Leaving Louisa, Garfield

took command of the 18th Brigade and began his march south on Paintsville.

He compelled the Confederates to abandon Paintsville and retreat to the

vicinity of Prestonsburg. Garfield slowly headed south, but swampy areas

and numerous streams slowed his movements, and he arrived in the vicinity

of Marshall on the 9th. Heading out at 4:00 am on January 10, Garfield

marched a mile south to the mouth of Middle Creek, fought off some Rebel

cavalry and turned west to attack Marshall. Marshall had put his men in

line of battle west and south of the creek near its forks. Garfield attacked

shortly after noon, and the fighting continued for most of the afternoon

until Union reinforcements arrived in time to dissuade the Confederates

from assailing the Federal left. Instead, the Rebels retired south and

were ordered back to Virginia on the 24th. Garfield’s force moved to Prestonsburg

after the fight and then retired to Paintsville. Union forces had halted

the Confederate 1861 offensive in Kentucky, and Middle Creek demonstrated

that their strength had not diminished. This victory, along with Mill Springs

a little more than a week later, cemented Union control of eastern Kentucky

until Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg launched his offensive in the summer

and fall. Following these two January victories in Kentucky, the Federals

carried the war into Tennessee in February.

<P><b>Result(s):</b> Union victory (indecisive)
