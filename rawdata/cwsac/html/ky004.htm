<P><b>Other Names:</b> Woodsonville, Green River

<P><b>Location:</b> Hart County

<P><b>Campaign:</b>  Kentucky Confederate Offensive (1861)
<b>
<P>Date(s):</b> December 17, 1861

<P><b>Principal Commanders:</b>  Col. August Willich [US]; Brig. Gen. Thomas C.

Hindman [CS]


<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> 32nd Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment [US]; Terry’s

Texas Rangers, 7th Texas Cavalry and 1st Arkansas Battalion (approx. 1,350

men) [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 131 total (US 40; CS 91)

<P><b>Description:</b> After Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell took command of the Department

of the Ohio in early November, he attempted to consolidate control by organizing

and sending troops into the field. He ordered Brig. Gen. Alexander McD.

McCook, commanding the 2nd Division, to Nolin, Kentucky. In the meantime,

the Confederates had established a defensive line along the Green River

near Munfordville. McCook launched a movement towards the enemy lines on

December 10, which the Rebels countered by partially destroying the Louisville

&amp; Nashville Railroad bridge over the Green River. As a result, the

Union sent two companies of the 32nd Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment

across the river to prevent a surprise and began constructing a pontoon

bridge for the passage of trains and artillery. When the bridge was completed

on December 17, four more of the 32nd Indiana companies crossed the river.

The combined force advanced to a hill south of Woodsonville where, in the

afternoon, they spotted enemy troops in the woods fronting them. Two companies

advanced toward the enemy in the woods, which fell back until Confederate

cavalry attacked. A general engagement ensued as eight Yankee companies

fought a much larger Confederate force. Fearing that the enemy might roll

up his right flank, Col. August Willich, commanding the regiment, ordered

a withdrawal to a stronger position in the rear. Knowing of McCook’s approach,

the Rebels also withdrew from the field. Although the results of the battle

were indecisive, Union troops did occupy the area and insured the movement

of their men and supplies on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad.




<P><b>Result(s):</b> Indecisive
