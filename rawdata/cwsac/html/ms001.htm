<p><b>Location:</b> Tishomingo County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Iuka and Corinth Operations (1862)


<p><b>Date(s):</b> September 19, 1862

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b>  Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans [US]; Maj. Gen.

Sterling Price [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> 2nd Division and cavalry division, Army of the Mississippi

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 1,482 total (US 782; CS 700)


<P><b>Description:</b>Maj. Gen. Sterling Price’s Army of the West main column

marched into Iuka, Mississippi, on September 14. Price’s superior, Gen.

Braxton Bragg, the commander of the Confederate Army of the Mississippi,

who was leading an offensive deep into Kentucky, ordered him to prevent

Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans’s Army of the Mississippi troops from moving

into Middle Tennessee and reinforcing Brig. Gen. James Negley’s division

of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell’s Army of the Ohio, which was garrisoning

Nashville. Price had about 14,000 men, and he was informed that, if necessary,

he could request assistance from Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, commanding the

District of the Mississippi, headquartered at Holly Springs. Maj. Gen.

Ulysses S. Grant, commanding the Army of the Tennessee, feared that Price

intended to go north to join Bragg against Buell. Grant devised a plan

for his left wing commander, Maj. Gen. E.O.C. Ord, and his men to advance

on Iuka from the west; Rosecrans’s forces were to march from the southwest,

arrive at Iuka on the 18th, and make a coordinated attack the next day.

Ord arrived on time and skirmishing ensued between his reconnaissance patrol

and Confederate pickets, about six miles from Iuka, before nightfall. Rosecrans

informed Grant that he would not arrive at Iuka on the 18th but would begin

his march at 4:30 am, the next morning. On the 19th, Ord sent Price a message

demanding that he surrender, but Price refused. At the same time, Price

received dispatches from Van Dorn suggesting that their two armies rendezvous,

as soon as possible, at Rienzi for attacks on the Federal forces in the

area. Price informed Van Dorn that the military situation had changed so

he could not evacuate Iuka immediately. He did, however, issue orders for

his men to prepare for a march the next day, to rendezvous with Van Dorn.

Rosecrans’s army marched early on the 19th, but, instead of using two roads

as directed, it followed the Jacinto (Bay Springs) Road. After considering

the amount of time that Rosecrans required to reach Iuka, Grant determined

that he probably would not arrive on the 19th, so he ordered Ord to await

the sound of fighting between Rosecrans and Price before engaging the Confederates.

As Rosecrans advanced, his men fought actions with Confederate troops at

points along the way. About 4:00 pm, just after ascending a hill, the Union

column halted because the Confederates were well-placed below in a ravine,

filled with timber and underbrush. The Confederates launched attacks up

the hill, capturing a six-gun Ohio battery, while the Federals counterattacked

from the ridge. Fighting, which Price later stated he had “never seen surpassed,”

continued until after dark; the Union troops camped for the night behind

the ridge. Price had redeployed troops from Ord’s front to fight against

Rosecrans’s people. Ord did nothing, later proclaiming that he never heard

any fighting and, therefore, never engaged the enemy; Grant also remarked

that he had heard no sounds of battle. Following the fighting on the 19th,

Price determined to reengage the enemy the next day, but his subordinates

convinced him, instead, to march to join Van Dorn, as earlier planned.

At the same time, Rosecrans redeployed his men for fighting the next day.

Price’s army evacuated via the uncovered Fulton Road, protected its rear

with a heavy rearguard and hooked up with Van Dorn five days later at Ripley.

Although Rosecrans was supposed to traverse Fulton Road and cover it, he

stated that he had not guarded the road because he feared dividing his

force; Grant later approved this decision. Rosecrans’s army occupied Iuka

and then mounted a pursuit; the Confederate rearguard and overgrown terrain

prevented the Union pursuit from accomplishing much. The Federals should

have destroyed or captured Price’s army, but instead the Rebels joined

Van Dorn and assaulted Corinth in October.



<P><b>Result(s):</b> Union victory (In addition, it caused Grant to have concern

about Rosecrans’s abilities and leadership.)
