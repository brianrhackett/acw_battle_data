<P><b>Other Names:</b> Pittsburg Landing
<p><b>Location:</b> Hardin County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Federal Penetration up the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers
(1862)
<p><b>Date(s):</b> April 6-7, 1862

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos
Buell [US]; Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston and Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Ohio (65,085)
[US]; Army of the Mississippi (44,968) [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 23,746 total (US 13,047; CS 10,699)

<P><b>Description:</b> As a result of the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson, Confederate
Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, the commander in the area, was forced to fall
back, giving up Kentucky and much of West and Middle Tennessee. He chose
Corinth, Mississippi, a major transportation center, as the staging area
for an offensive against Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the
Tennessee before the Army of the Ohio, under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell,
could join it. The Confederate retrenchment was a surprise, although a
pleasant one, to the Union forces, and it took Grant, with about 40,000
men, some time to mount a southern offensive, along the Tennessee River,
toward Pittsburg Landing. Grant received orders to await Buell’s Army of
the Ohio at Pittsburg Landing. Grant did not choose to fortify his position;
rather, he set about drilling his men many of which were raw recruits.
Johnston originally planned to attack Grant on April 4, but delays postponed
it until the 6th. Attacking the Union troops on the morning of the 6th,
the Confederates surprised them, routing many. Some Federals made determined
stands and by afternoon, they had established a battle line at the sunken
road, known as the “Hornets Nest.” Repeated Rebel attacks failed to carry
the Hornets Nest, but massed artillery helped to turn the tide as Confederates
surrounded the Union troops and captured, killed, or wounded most.&nbsp;
Johnston had been mortally wounded earlier and his second in command, Gen.
P.G.T. Beauregard, took over. The Union troops established another line
covering Pittsburg Landing, anchored with artillery and augmented by Buell’s
men who began to arrive and take up positions. Fighting continued until
after dark, but the Federals&nbsp; held. By the next morning, the combined
Federal forces numbered about 40,000, outnumbering Beauregard’s army of
less than 30,000. Beauregard was unaware of the arrival of Buell’s army
and launched a counterattack in response to a two-mile advance by William
Nelson’s division of Buell’s army at 6:00 am, which was, at first, successful.
Union troops stiffened and began forcing the Confederates back. Beauregard
ordered a counterattack, which stopped the Union advance but did not break
its battle line. At this point, Beauregard realized that he could not win
and, having suffered too many casualties, he retired from the field and
headed back to Corinth. On the 8th, Grant sent Brig. Gen. William T. Sherman,
with two brigades, and Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, with his division, in
pursuit of Beauregard. They ran into the Rebel rearguard, commanded by
Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest, at Fallen Timbers. Forrest’s aggressive tactics,
although eventually contained, influenced the Union troops to return to
Pittsburg Landing. Grant’s mastery of the Confederate forces continued;
he had beaten them once again. The Confederates continued to fall back
until launching their mid-August offensive.
