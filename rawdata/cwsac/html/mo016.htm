<P><b>Other Names:</b> None

<P><b>Location:</b> Newton County

<P><b>Campaign:</b> Operations North of Boston Mountains (1862)

<P><b>Date(s):</b> September 30, 1862

<P><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Brig. Gen. Friedrich Salomon [US]; Col. Douglas

H. Cooper [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Two brigades, Army of Kansas (1,500) [US]; Cooper's

Division [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 345 total (US 245; CS 100)

<P><b>Description:</b> Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, in March 1862, most

Confederate and Union troops left northwestern Arkansas and southwestern

Missouri. By late summer, Confederates returned to the area, which caused

much apprehension in nearby Federally-occupied Springfield, Missouri, and

Fort Scott, Kansas. Confederate Col. Douglas Cooper reached the area on

the 27th and assigned two of his units to Newtonia where there was a mill

for making breadstuffs. In mid-September, two brigades of Brig. Gen. James

G. Blunt’s Union Army of Kansas left Fort Scott for Southwest Missouri.

On the 29th, Union scouts approached Newtonia but were chased away. Other

Union troops appeared in nearby Granby where there were lead mines, and

Cooper sent some reinforcements there. The next morning, Union troops appeared

before Newtonia and fighting ensued by 7:00 am. The Federals began driving

the enemy, but Confederate reinforcements arrived, swelling the numbers.

The Federals gave way and retreated in haste. As they did so, some of their

reinforcements appeared and helped to stem their retreat. The Union forces

then renewed the attack, threatening the enemy right flank. But newly arrived

Confederates stopped that attack and eventually forced the Federals to

retire again. Pursuit of the Federals continued after dark. Union gunners

posted artillery in the roadway to halt the pursuit. As Confederate gunners

observed the Union artillery fire for location, they fired back, creating

panic. The Union retreat turned into a rout as some ran all the way to

Sarcoxie, more than ten miles away. Although the Confederates won the battle,

they were unable to maintain themselves in the area given the great numbers

of Union troops. Most Confederates retreated into northwest Arkansas. The

1862 Confederate victories in southwestern Missouri at Newtonia and Clark’s

Mill were the South’s apogee in the area; afterwards, the only Confederates

in the area belonged to raiding columns.
