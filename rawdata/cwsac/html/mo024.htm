<P><b>Other Names:</b> Westport

<P><b>Location:</b> Jackson County

<P><b>Campaign:</b> Price’s Missouri Expedition (1864)

<P><b>Date(s):</b> October 21, 1864

<P><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis [US]; Maj. Gen. Sterling

Price [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> 1st Division, Army of the Border [US]; Army of Missouri

[CS]


<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> Unknown

<P><b>Description:</b>  Price’s march along the Missouri River was slow, providing

the Yankees a chance to concentrate. Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, commanding

the Department of the Missouri, proposed a pincer movement to trap Price

and his army, but he was unable to communicate with Maj. Gen. Samuel R.

Curtis, commander of the Department of Kansas, to formalize the plan. Curtis

was having problems because many of his troops were Kansas militia and

they refused to enter Missouri, but a force of about 2,000 men under the

command of Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt did set out for Lexington. He met the

Confederate troops at Lexington on the 19th, slowed their progress, but

was defeated and retreated. On the 20th, Blunt’s troops arrived on the

Little Blue River, eight miles east of Independence. The Union force prepared

to engage the Confederates again in a strong defensive position on the

west bank. Curtis, however, ordered Blunt into Independence while leaving

a small force, under Col. Thomas Moonlight, on the Little Blue. The next

day, Curtis ordered Blunt to take all of the volunteers and return to the

Little Blue. As he neared the stream, he discovered that Moonlight’s small

force had burned the bridge as ordered, engaged the enemy, and retreated

away from the strong defensive position occupied the day before, crossing

the river. Blunt entered the fray and attempted to drive the enemy back

beyond the defensive position that he wished to reoccupy. The Yankees forced

the Confederates to fall back, at first, but their numerical superiority

took its toll in the five-hour battle. The Federals retreated to Independence

and went into camp there after dark. Once again, the Confederates had been

slowed and more Union reinforcements were arriving.
