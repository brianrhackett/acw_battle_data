<p><b>Campaign:</b> Iuka and Corinth Operations (1862)
<p><b>Date(s):</b> October 3-4, 1862

Gen. Earl Van Dorn [CS]

<P><b>Description:</b> After the Battle of Iuka, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price’s Confederate

Army of the West marched from Baldwyn to Ripley where it joined Maj. Gen.

Earl Van Dorn’s Army of West Tennessee. Van Dorn was senior officer and

took command of the combined force numbering about 22,000 men. The Rebels

marched to Pocahontas on October 1, and then moved southeast toward Corinth.

They hoped to seize Corinth and then sweep into Middle Tennessee. Since

the Siege of Corinth, in the spring, Union forces had erected various fortifications,

an inner and intermediate line, to protect Corinth, an important transportation

center. With the Confederate approach, the Federals, numbering about 23,000,

occupied the outer line of fortifications and placed men in front of them.

Van Dorn arrived within three miles of Corinth at 10:00 am on October 3,

and moved into some fieldworks that the Confederates had erected for the

siege of Corinth. The fighting began, and the Confederates steadily pushed

the Yankees rearward. A gap occurred between two Union brigades which the

Confederates exploited around 1:00 pm. The Union troops moved back in a

futile effort to close the gap. Price then attacked and drove the Federals

back further to their inner line. By evening, Van Dorn was sure that he

could finish the Federals off during the next day. This confidence--combined

with the heat, fatigue, and water shortages--persuaded him to cancel any

further operations that day. Rosecrans regrouped his men in the fortifications

to be ready for the attack to come the next morning. Van Dorn had planned

to attack at daybreak, but Brig. Gen. Louis H&eacute;bert’s sickness postponed

it till 9:00 am. As the Confederates moved forward, Union artillery swept

the field causing heavy casualties, but the Rebels continued on. They stormed

Battery Powell and closed on Battery Robinett, where desperate hand-to-hand

fighting ensued. A few Rebels fought their way into Corinth, but the Federals

quickly drove them out. The Federals continued on, recapturing Battery

Powell, and forcing Van Dorn into a general retreat. Rosecrans postponed

any pursuit until the next day. As a result, Van Dorn was defeated, but

not destroyed or captured, at Hatchie Bridge, Tennessee, on October 5.
