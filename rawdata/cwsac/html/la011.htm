<p><b>Location:</b> Madison Parish


<p><b>Campaign:</b> Grant’s Operations against Vicksburg (1863)

<p><b>Date(s):</b> June 7, 1863

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Col. Hermann Lieb [US]; Brig. Gen. Henry E. McCulloch

[CS]
<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> African Brigade and the 23rd Iowa Volunteer Infantry

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 837 total (US 652; CS 185)

<P><b>Description:</b> On June 6, Col. Hermann Lieb with the African Brigade and

two companies of the 10th Illinois Cavalry made a reconnaissance toward

Richmond, Louisiana. About three miles from Richmond, Lieb encountered

enemy troops at the Tallulah railroad depot and drove them back but then

retired, fearing that many more Rebels might be near. While retiring, a

squad of Union cavalry appeared, fleeing from a force of Rebels. Lieb got

his men into battle line and helped disperse the pursuing enemy. He then

retired to Milliken’s Bend and informed his superior by courier of his

actions. The 23rd Iowa Infantry and two gunboats came to his assistance.

Around 3:00 am on June 7, Rebels appeared in force and drove in the pickets.

They continued their movement towards the Union left flank. The Federal

forces fired some volleys that caused the Rebel line to pause momentarily,

but the Texans soon pushed on to the levee where they received orders to

charge. In spite of receiving more volleys, the Rebels came on, and hand-to-hand

combat ensued. In this intense fighting, the Confederates succeeded in

flanking the Union force and caused tremendous casualties with enfilade

fire. The Union force fell bank to the river’s bank. About that time Union

gunboats <I>Choctaw</I> and <I>Lexington</I> appeared and fired upon the

Rebels. The Confederates continued firing and began extending their right

to envelop the Federals but failed in their objective. Fighting continued

until noon when the Confederates withdrew. The Union pursued, firing many

volleys, and the gunboats pounded the Confederates as they retreated to

Walnut Bayou.
