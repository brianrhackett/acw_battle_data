<P><b>Description:</b> After Union forces began occupying the Louisiana river

parishes, thousands of escaped slaves flocked to them. The Federals, therefore,

leased some plantations and put the freedmen to work growing cotton or

other crops; the proceeds from the sale of the crops helped defray expenses

for food, clothing, etc. African-American troops were assigned to protect

these plantations, releasing other troops to fight. Confederates, determined

to recapture some of these freedmen and destroy the crops, undertook an

expedition from Gaines’s Landing, Arkansas, to Lake Providence. The Federals

had constructed a fort on an Indian mound to protect some of these leased

plantations. The Rebels prepared to attack the fort on the 29th but decided

to demand unconditional surrender first, which the Union forces accepted.

Later in the day, Confederate Col. W.H. Parsons fought companies of the

1st Kansas Mounted Infantry. The Rebels then began burning and destroying

the surrounding plantations, especially those that the Yankees leased.

By the next morning, U.S. Naval boats had landed the Mississippi Marine

Brigade, under the command of Brig. Gen. Alfred W. Ellet, at Goodrich’s

Landing. At dawn, he set out with Col. William F. Wood’s African-American

units to find the Rebels. Ellet’s cavalry found the Confederates first

and began skirmishing. The fight became more intense as Ellet’s other forces

approached. Parsons eventually disengaged and fell back. Although the Confederates

disrupted these operations, destroyed much property, and captured many

supplies and weapons, the raid was a minor setback for the Union. The Confederates

could cause momentary disturbances, but they were unable to effect any

lasting changes.
