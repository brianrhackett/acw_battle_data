<P><b>Description:</b> On May 9, 1863, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston received a dispatch

from the Confederate Secretary of War directing him to “proceed at once

to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field.” As he

arrived in Jackson on the 13th, from Middle Tennessee, he learned that

two army corps from the Union Army of the Tennessee—the XV, under Maj.

Gen. William T. Sherman, and the XVII, under Maj. Gen. James Birdseye McPherson—were

advancing on Jackson, intending to cut the city and the railroads off from

Vicksburg. Johnston consulted with the local commander, Brig. Gen. John

Gregg, and learned that only about 6,000 troops were available to defend

the town. Johnston ordered the evacuation of Jackson, but Gregg was to

defend Jackson until the evacuation was completed. By 10:00 am, both Union

army corps were near Jackson and had engaged the enemy. Rain, Confederate

resistance, and poor defenses prevented heavy fighting until around 11:00

am, when Union forces attacked in numbers and slowly but surely pushed

the enemy back. In mid-afternoon, Johnston informed Gregg that the evacuation

was complete and that he should disengage and follow. Soon after, the Yankees

entered Jackson and had a celebration, hosted by Maj. Gen. U.S. Grant who

had been travelling with Sherman’s corps, in the Bowman House. They then

burned part of the town and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg.

Johnston’s evacuation of Jackson was a tragedy because he could, by late

on the 14th, have had 11,000 troops at his disposal and by the morning

of the 15th, another 4,000. The fall of the former Mississippi state capital

was a blow to Confederate morale.
