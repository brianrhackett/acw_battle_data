Principal commanders of the battles listed in Clodfelter (2008) *Warfare and Armed Conflicts*.

Clodfelter does not directly list the principal commander of the battles. These were added for this data. They primarily follow the principal commanders for each battle given by the CWSAC (:doc:`cwsac_commanders`).
