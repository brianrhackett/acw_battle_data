Battle casualty data from William F. Fox *Regimental Losses in the American Civil War,
1861-1865: A Treatise on the extent and nature of the mortuary losses in
the Union regiments, with full and exhaustive statistics compiled from
the official records on file in the state military bureaus and at
Washington*, available from `Perseus <http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2001.05.0068>`__.

The data on casualties come from the main table in "Chapter 14: the greatest battles of the war — list of victories and defeats — chronological list of battles with loss in each, Union and Confederate", p. 544-551.
The accompanying description reads

    There were 112 battles in the war, in which one side or the other
    lost over 500 in killed and wounded. In all, there were 1,882
    general engagements, battles, skirmishes, or affairs in which at
    least one regiment was engaged.

    With this chapter is given a chronological list of the battles and
    minor engagements, showing the loss in each. The figures are
    compiled from the battle reports and revised casualty lists in
    the. “Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies,”
    published, or in process of publication, by the War Department at
    Washington.

    The figures in the table of Confederate losses are the ones
    officially reported by the Confederate generals in command, or by
    their surgeon-general, to whom, in many instances, that duty seems
    to have been entrusted. There are no official Confederate casualty
    reports for the latter part of the war, and so there is no
    statement of loss for several battles. Estimates might be quoted,
    but such figures are not within the province of this work.

The data in that tables are split into a table with battles and one with
force level casualties.

The results of battles is considered seperately in :doc:`fox_outcomes`.
