      CWSAC summary

         In most summaries, the particular company, regiment, brigade, division, corps, army, garrison, detachment, or ship. Some summaries, however, indicate the number of troops involved. In both cases, the purpose is to provide an idea of the size of the engagement. Most of the forces engaged were found in the U.S. War Department's Official Records.

      CWSAC description of casualties

         No source exists, either in print or in manuscript, that
         provides casualty figures for all Civil War battles or even
         for the 384 principal battles that the CWSAC studied. Some of
         the casualty figures for the 384 principal battles are
         unknown; in some instances reliable figures are available for
         one of the combatants but not for the other. Few casualty
         figures are definitive; sources often differ in their
         figures. A variety of sources, both official and commercial,
         printed and in manuscript, were consulted. All casualty
         figures were subjected to historical analysis before
         inclusion in the summaries.

    title: Preservation Priority
    type: string
    description: >-

      A designation made by the Commission based on the level of historical significance, the integrity of the remaining battlefield features, and the level of threat to the battlefield's existence. For example, IV.1 (Class D) means that the Commission determined that a particular battlefield site was Priority IV: Fragmented Battlefields, All Military Classes, Poor Integrity. (See Table 7, pages 49-53 in the Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefield, for the preservation priority of all the battlefields studied.) Class A, B, C, or D indicates a battle's (and associated battlefield's) level of military importance within its campaign and the war. (See page v of this volume for an explanation of each of the four designations.) N/D indicates that no data is currently available to determine the levelof threat to the site.
