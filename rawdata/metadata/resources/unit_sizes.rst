See the `source <https://github.com/jrnold/acw_battle_data/blob/master/rawdata/unit_sizes/unit_sizes.Rmd>`__ for the details of how this data was simuated.
This data is used for estimates of strenghts in battles when the source gives only the number and types of units (e.g. :doc:`clodfelter_forces`, :doc:`cwsac_forces`, :doc:`cws2_forces`).
