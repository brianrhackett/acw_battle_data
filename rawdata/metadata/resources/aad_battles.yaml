    name: theater
    title: Theater
    type: string

      The name of the theater. 1 Main Eastern Theater of operation. 2
      Lower Seaboard Theater of Operation. 3 Main Western Theater of
      Operations & the Gulf Approach (1861-1863). 4 Trans-Mississippi
      Theater of Operations 5 Pacific Coast Theater Robert N. Scott,
      the overall editor of The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of
      the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies
      (Washington, DC: The Government Printing Office, 1880-1901),
      arranged Series I, of that publication, according to the
      campaigns and several theaters of operations .... The Official
      Records editors recognized five theaters of operations, Main
      Eastern, Lower Seaboard, Main Western, Trans-Mississippi, and
      Pacific Coast. Dr. Dallas D. Irvine, the creator and major
      compiler-editor of Military Operations of the Civil War: A
      Guide-Index to Official Records of the Union and Confederate
      Armies, 1861-1865 (Washington, DC: The Government Printing
      Office, 1968-80), modified this arrangement by removing the Gulf
      Approach operations from the Main Western Theater and combining
      them with the Lower Seaboard Theater. The Commission study used
      Irvine's classification system.

The field surveyors and the Commission staff did not consult official ownership records, such as County tax records or maps. Many of the battle sites probably have more kinds of ownership than indicated in the Commission's database.

    name: integrity
    title: integrity
    type: string
    description: >-
      Integrity is the measure of the battle site's condition.
      
      A battle site with fair integrity is largely intact with some changes in primary geographical and topographical configuration and mass and scale of the buildings.
      
      A battle site with good integrity is essentially unchanged from the historic period with respect to terrain, land use, road network, and mass and scale of buildings.

      A battle site with poor integrity is significantly altered in terms of its primary geographical and topographical configuration and mass and scale of the buildings. Road construction and changes in land use are usually evident at sites with poor integrity. Sites with poor integrity sometimes retain core parcels (50-200 acres) intact within the generally fragmented landscape.

      A local site has changed beyond recognition, meaning that a local resident of the time returning to the site today presumably would not recognize his surroundings. Lost battlefields may retain small (1-50 acres) parcels suitable for commemoration, however, the ability to interpret the battle on the landscape has been lost.

      Formative: An engagement involving divisions or detachments of the field armies in which a commader accomplished a limited campaign objective of reconnaissance, disruption, defense, or occupation. Formative battles had an observable influence on the direction, duration, or conduct of the campaign.
      
      Limited: An engagement, typically involving detachments of the field armies, in which a commander achived a limited tactical objective of reconnaissance, defense, or occupation. Limited battles maintained contact between the combatants without observable influence on the direction of the campaign.
      
      Major: An engagement of magnitude involving field armies or divisions of the armies in which a commander achived an important strategic objective within the context of an ongoing campaign offensive. Major battles had a direct, observable impact on the direction, duration, conduct, or outcome of the campaign.
