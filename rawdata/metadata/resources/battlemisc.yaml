    description: Was this a naval battles? "Yes" if at least one of the side's forces
      consisted of only ships, e.g. ship vs. ship battles or ship vs. land fortifications.
      If "Partial", then land forces were involved on both sides, but ships were part
      of at least one side's forces. If "No", then no naval forces were involved.
