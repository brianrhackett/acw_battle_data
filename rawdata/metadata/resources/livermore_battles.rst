Battle data from Livermore (1900) *Number and Losses in the Civil War in America, 1861-1865*.

Livermore discusses his methodology on pp. 63-77. The sample of
battles he uses is all battles in which either side had losses, killed
wounded, greater than 1,000.

Livermore is concerned with determining the actual number of troops
engaged in battle, i.e. those that actually participated. The majority
of the book is devoted to the calculations of the values of the
strengths of the forces in each battle.

When discussing the categorization of battles into victories and
defeats, Livermore writes,

    For further comparison of losses under similar conditions, the 63
    battles of Table B may be classified as follows, although
    discrimination must be made between those which are styled defeats,
    because some are ranged under this head merely because the field was
    abandoned; when considered tactically, the retreating army was
    successful in the battle itself.
