  - description: 'Study area in acres

      The Study Area represents the historic extent of the battle as it unfolded across
      the landscape. The Study Area contains resources known to relate to or contribute
      to the battle event: where troops maneuvered and deployed, immediately before
      and after combat, and where they fought during combat. Historic accounts, terrain
      analysis, and feature identification inform the delineation of the Study Area
      boundary.  Historic setting, approaches, and natural features that figure importantly
      in the battle are defining elements. The Study Area indicates the extent to
      which historic and archeological resources associated with the battle (areas
      of combat, command, communications, logistics, medical services, etc.) may be
      found and protected. Surveyors delineated Study Area boundaries for every battle
      site that was positively identified through research and field survey, regardless
      of its present integrity.'

      The Core Area represents the areas of direct engagement on the battlefield.
      Positions that delivered or received fire, and the space connecting them, fall
      within the Core Area.  Frequently described as “hallowed ground,” land within
      the Core Area is often the first to be targeted for protection. There may be
      more than one Core Area on a battlefield, but all lie within the Study Area.'

      Unlike the Study and Core Area, which are based only upon the interpretation
      of historic events, the Potential National Register (PotNR) boundary represents
      ABPP’s assessment of a Study Area’s current integrity (the surviving landscape
      and features that convey the site’s historic sense of place). The PotNR boundary
      may include all or some of the Study Area, and all or some of the Core Area.
      Although preparing a National Register nomination may require further assessment
      of historic integrity and more documentation than that provided by the ABPP
      survey, PotNR boundaries identify land that merits this additional effort.'
