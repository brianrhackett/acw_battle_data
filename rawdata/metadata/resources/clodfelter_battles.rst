Battle data for the battles of the American Civil War in Clodfelter, M. (2008) *Warfare And Armed Conflicts: A Statistical
Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1494-2007*.

Clodfelter has no strict rule for the inclusion of battles; his criteria is to include "all important and significant actions and the results of each conflict" (p. 1).
No casualty threshhold is used to select battles because that would have to vary across wars to produce sensical results.

Clodfelter divides the American Civil War into three theaters

- Eastern
- Western
- Blockade War

and divides the battles into thirteen groups: East (1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865), West (1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865), and Blocade War (1861--1862, 1863, 1864--1865).
