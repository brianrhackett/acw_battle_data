Battle-level data of the battles in the original reports of the Civil War Sites Advisory Commision compiled during 1990-1993.

These reports were deposited with the `National Archives <https://archives.gov>`__ `Access to Archival Databases <https://aad.archives.gov/aad/series-description.jsp?s=1076&cat=WR25&bc=,sl>`__.

Each observation in the data is a battle.
The battles are those identified by the CWSAC as the prinicipal battles of the American Civil War, and later used in the official CWSAC Report and its updates, and the CWSS database.

The original documentation reads:

    The Civil War Sites Advisory Commission created this database to
    support its congressional mandate to identify Civil War
    battlefields, determine their historic significance, assess short-
    and long-term threats to their integrity, and propose new ideas
    about their preservation and interpretation. The Commission
    intended the recommendations to be used as the basis for
    legislative proposals in the area of battlefield preservation.

    The Civil War Sites Advisory Commission data files contain
    information relating to battlefields of the American Civil War,
    1861-1865. Four data files compose this series: Events, Counties,
    Campaign, and Theater files. The Events file is the primary data
    file. Of 10,500 armed conflicts in the military history of the
    Civil War, the file contains information on 384 conflicts that the
    Commission identified as the principal battles. Each record
    identifies the following information: state and county or counties
    of the historic site, the type of battle or event that occurred
    there, the theater of operations and the campaign to which the
    engagement relates, the dates of the battle or event, the current
    ownership of the site, and the assessment of three subject area
    experts of the military significance, physical integrity, historic
    preservation status, and interpretive potential of the site or
    event, and whether it should be a priority for protection of
    cultural property. The records of the Counties file identify the
    county location(s) of each battlefield and are linked to the
    Events file by a common battlefield reference number. The records
    of the Campaign file include a code for each of 116 campaigns and
    provide its name, dates, and a ranking of the military importance
    of the campaign's battle events. The records of the Campaign file
    are linked by the campaign code to the records in the Events
    file. The Theater file records identify five designated Civil War
    theaters of operation and are linked to the Events file by a
    theater code.

    The records in this file potentially identify the following information: state and county or counties of the historic site, the type of battle or event that occurred there, the theater of operations and the campaign to which the engagement relates, the dates of the battle or event, the current ownership of the site, and the assessment of three subject area experts of the military significance, physical integrity, historic preservation status, and interpretive potential of the site or event, and whether it should be a priority for protection of cultural property.
