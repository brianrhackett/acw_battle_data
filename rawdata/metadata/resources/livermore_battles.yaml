      Seperate Union and Confederate results are given because the results in the tables are not symmetric.
      In some cases, one side is missing. In some cases, even if side has a victory, the other side can have a loss or a rout.

      This comes from the tables "Routs", "Victories", and "Battles Fought to Cover a Prearranged Movement, Pursuing which the Army Retired after Repelling Attack", on p. 76--77.
