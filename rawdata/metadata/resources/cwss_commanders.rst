Principal commanders of the battles in the CWSS database.
Each side in a battle in :doc:`cwss_battles` has one or more commanders.
These commanders are largely the same as those in :doc:`cwsac_commanders` and :doc:`cws2_commanders` with some differences for unknown reasons.

This data was extracted from the CWSS database file ``battle.xml``.
