Engagements and casualties in Frederick Dyer *Compendium of the War of the Rebellion* (1908)

This contains the engagements listed in Dyer's *Compendium*, "Part II: Chronological Arrangement of the Campaigns, Battles, Engagements, Actions, Combats, Sieges, Skirmishes, Etc., in the United States, Connected with the War of the Rebellion, 1861 to 1865."
Dyer's list is a tabular version of the engagements reported in the *Official Records of the War of the Rebellion*.
For each engagment it notes the location, type of engagement (action, skirmish, etc.), Union units engaged in the action, and Union casualties. It does not provide any information 

Dyer's description of the engagements was as follows (p. 581),

  Campagains, Battles, Engagements, Skirmishes, etc. showing Union troops engaged in each event.

  This list shows loss of only such campaigns, battles, skirmishes, etc., as were, in this particular, officially reported. The losses of many actions, skirmishes, erc. occuring in the various campaigns were included in the final statement of the campaign, making it impossible to give accurately the loss in each event. Many of the skirmishes and other events show no loss whatever, or report none. All important campaigns, battles, raids, etc., will be found on this list, however, showing losses as officially reported.
  
The data are extracted from the digitalized version of the battles in Tufts University's `Perseus Digital Library <http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2001.05.0140>`__.
This corresponds to pages 662-991 of Dyer's *Compendium*, ignoring indexes.
