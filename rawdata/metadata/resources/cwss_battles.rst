Battles of the Civil War Soldiers and Sailors (CWSS) database.
These battles are largely the same set as in the CWSAC Report (:doc:`cwsac_battles`) with a few exceptions, some of which appear to be errors.

This data was extracted from the CWSS database file ``battle.xml``.

Three battles are excluded from the original dataset since they do not contain
complete data and are not otherwise included in the CWSAC: VA126, GA024, and AL008.
