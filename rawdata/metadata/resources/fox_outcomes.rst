Battle outcome from William F. Fox *Regimental Losses in the American Civil War,

the Union regiments, with full and exhaustive statistics compiled from
the official records on file in the state military bureaus and at

Fox categorizes battles by their outcome for a subset of those battles for which casualty figures are provided, in :doc:`fox_forces`. In some cases, the battle definitions are slightly different.

In Chapter 14, p. 541-543 Fox has several tables classifying battles into victories for each side.
Both his categories and classifications are similar to Livermore (1900).

   In connection with these matters the question naturally arises,--Which
   were victories, and which were defeats?

   To answer fairly and without prejudice would only invite bitter and
   senseless criticism from both sides. It is too soon to attempt any
   discussion of this much vexed topic. Still, there are certain
   conceded facts relative to this matter which one might venture to
   recall to mind.  They may be premised with the military
   axioms,--that when an army retains possession of the battle field
   and buries its enemy's dead, it certainly cannot be considered as a
   defeated army; and that when an army abandons the field, either
   slowly or in rout, and leaves its dead and wounded in the hands of
   the enemy, it certainly should not claim a victory.

Fox classifies battle outcomes into the following five categories,

    In the following named battles the Union armies remained in undisturbed
    possession of the field, the enemy leaving many of their wounded, and
    most of their dead unburied

    The Union armies were successful, also, in the following assaults. They
    were the attacking party, and carried the forts, or intrenched
    positions, by storm.

    In the following battles, the Confederates remained in undisturbed
    possession of the field, the Union armies leaving its unburied dead and
    many of its wounded in their hands:

    In the following assaults the Confederates successfully repulsed the
    attacks of the enemy

    In the following assaults, or sorties, the Confederates were the
    attacking party, and were repulsed

With regards to battles not considered, Fox writes,

    Other instances on each side could be mentioned, but they would invite
    discussion and are better omitted.
