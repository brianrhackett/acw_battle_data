Force level data combining the National Park Services reports: Shenandoah, preliminary CWSAC reports in the AAD (1990-1993), CWSAC Report battle summaries (1997), Civil War Soldiers and Sailors (CWSS) database, and the CWSAC Report Updates (2009-2013).

For each of the casualty types and strength a mean and variance is provided. The values of casualties come from the CWSS, and CWSAC reports, in that order of preference.
The values of strength come from the CWSS, CWSAC II, and CWSAC reports, in that order of preference.

- mean: the given value, or the midpoint if a range is given.
- variance:

   - If a range is given, the variance of a uniform distribution with that range.
   - If no range is given, the measurement error implied by rounding. :math:`var(x) = \frac{1}{12} 10^k`, where :math:`k` is the number of zeros in the value.
