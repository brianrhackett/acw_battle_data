List of battles included in the AAD CWSAC Reports (1990-1993), CWSAC Report Battle Summaries (1997), CWSAC Report Updates (2009-2013), and the CWSS. All these reports from the National Park Service use the same battle identifiers, but they differ slightly in their composition.


A couple notes about the set of battles in these data.

- In an update on the status of battlefields `Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report Update & Resurvey <http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/CWSII/CWSII.htm>`_,
  the following changes were made.

  - AR018,  Battle of Bayou Meto (Reed's Bridge) on Aug 27, 1863 (part of the Advance on Little Rock campaign) was added. See
    `Civil War Battlefields in the State of Arkansas - Arkansas Post to Devils Backbone <http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/CWSII/ArkansasBattlefieldProfiles/Arkansas%20Post%20to%20Devils%20Backbone.pdf>`_.
  - SC007. Fort Wagner II. Dates changed to 7-18. `Report Update
    <http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/CWSII/SouthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles/SouthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles.pdf>`_.
  - SC008. Fort Sumter II. Dates changed to 8-17 to 9-8. `Report
    Update
    <http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/CWSII/SouthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles/SouthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles.pdf>`_.
  - SC009. Charleston Harbor. Dates changed to Aug 22-23, 1863 and
    Sept 5-8, 1863.  This really appears to be to engagements.  The
    assault on Fort Sumter is the only engagement referenced in the
    initial CWSAC report.  `Report Update
    <http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/CWSII/SouthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles/SouthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles.pdf>`_.

    - Aug 22-23, 1863 Bombardment of Charleston by the Swamp Angel
    - Sept 5-8, 1863. Assault on Fort Sumter.

  - VA020A and VA020B combined into a single battle, `Source
    <http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/White%20oak%20Road%20to%20Wilderness.pdf>`_.

	 Although the CWSAC identified the engagements at White Oak
	 Swamp and Glendale as part of the same offensive, it mapped the
	 battlefields individually. Upon further study, the ABPP decided to
	 combine the two engagements under one Study Area.

The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002 directed the NPS to
update their 1993 battlefield surveys. The results of the resurvey are
available `here
<http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/CWSIIStateReports.htm>`_.
These battles are largely the same as in the first CWSAC, with a few exceptions.

- Battles Glendale (VA020A) and White Oak Swamp (VA020B) were combined
  into a single battle.

    Upon review of the histories of the battles, the ABPP has combined
    White Oak Swamp (VA020a) and Glendale (VA020b) into a single
    entry: the overall count is one battlefield fewer, but both
    engagement areas are included. `Update to the Civil War Sites
    Advisory Commission Report: Commonwealth of Virigina
    <http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/CWSACReportVirginiaUpdate.pdf>`_
    (p. 8).

- The Battle of Bayou Meto (AR018) was added. However, it does not
  appear to have been added strictly due to historical judgment of
  importance.  No military significance or casualties is given for
  this battle.

	The CWSAC did not list Bayou Meto (Reed’s Bridge) as one of
	the principal battles of the Civil War. In 2002, however, the
	battlefield was listed in the National Register of Historic
	Places as a nationally significant historic property. Given
	the high level of significance conferred by the NRHP listing,
	the ABPP decided, as part of the fieldwork undertaken for this
	update, to assess conditions at Bayou Meto.  ` Update to the
	Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report: State of Arkansas
	<http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/CWSACReportArkansasUpdate.pdf>`_ (p. 8)

- The Battle of Athens (AL002) is redefined from the battle on January 26, 1863
  to the battle on September 23-25, 1963. Because of this I give
  the new battle the code **AL009**.  I also think that the results in the document
  are referring to the January battle because the September battle is unambiguously
  a Confederate victory.
- new variables: Acreage of the battlefield area
- revised variables: forces, principal commanders, result, battle
  dates
- Native American forces. Oklahoma battles OK001 (Round Mountain), OK002
  (Chusto-Talasah), and OK003 (Chustenahlah) classify the Creek forces
  under Opothleyahola as [US] instead of [I].  In CWSAC II, the only
  battles involving purely Native American forces are against the
  Union and generally part of the Sioux Wars (Minnesota, North Dakota,
  Idaho).  This seems reasonable, the Creek and Seminole forces in the
  Oklahoma battles were Union allies, while the
  Sioux Indian forces fighting the Union were not allied with the
  Confederacy.

For the most part, each CWSAC battle page corresponds to a single Wikipedia page,
making linking the two easy.

The one exception is that CWSAC considers the Battle of Chattanooga
(http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/tn024.htm) from Nov 23-25, 1863 a
single battle. However, in Wikipedia this corresponds to two battles
in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga_Campaign:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lookout_Mountain on Nov 24, and
the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Missionary_Ridge on Nov 25.

The set of battles around Charleston Harbor July to September 1863 is confusingly
and ambiguously defined by the CWSAC.

The battles considered and the summaries from their pages are copied below.

Charleston Harbor I (SC004) occurred on April 7, 1863, and was a naval
battle between Union ships and the Charleston Harbor forts.

CWSAC Fort Wagner I (SC005)

  On July 10, Union artillery on Folly Island together with Rear
  Adm. John Dahlgren’s fleet of ironclads opened fire on Confederate
  defenses of Morris Island. The bombardment provided cover for
  Brig. Gen. George C. Strong’s brigade, which crossed Light House Inlet
  and landed by boats on the southern tip of the island. Strong’s troops
  advanced, capturing several batteries, to within range of Confederate
  Fort Wagner. At dawn, July 11, Strong attacked the fort. Soldiers of
  the 7th Connecticut reached the parapet but, unsupported, were thrown
  back.   http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/sc005.htm

CWSAC Fort Wagner II (SC007)

  After the July 11 assault on Fort Wagner failed, Gillmore reinforced
  his beachhead on Morris Island. At dusk July 18, Gillmore launched an
  attack spearheaded by the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, a black
  regiment. The unit’s colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, was killed. Members
  of the brigade scaled the parapet but after brutal hand-to-hand combat
  were driven out with heavy casualties. The Federals resorted to siege
  operations to reduce the fort. This was the fourth time in the war
  that black troops played a crucial combat role, proving to skeptics
  that they would fight bravely if only given the chance.

Fort Sumter II (SC008)

  Federal batteries erected on Morris Island opened fire on August 17
  and continued their bombardment of Fort Sumter and the Charleston
  defenses until August 23. Despite a severe pounding, Fort Sumter’s
  garrison held out. Siege operations continued against Fort Wagner on
  Morris Island. http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/sc008.htm

CWSAC Charleston Harbor II (SC009)

  During the night of September 6-7, Confederate forces evacuated Fort
  Wagner and Battery Gregg pressured by advancing Federal
  siegeworks. Federal troops then occupied all of Morris Island. On
  September 8, a storming party of about 400 marines and sailors
  attempted to surprise Fort Sumter. The attack was repulsed.

CWSAC II added the August bombardment of Charleston by the "The Swamp Angel"
to Charleston Harbor II.

Timeline of July-September events in the  1863 siege of Charleston

- July 10-11. First Battle of Fort Wagner. Failed Union assault.
- July 16. Battle of Grimball's landing. Union defeated in attempt to take Charleston by land.
- July 18. Second failed assault on Fort Wagner
- July 19 Union begins siege of Fort Wagner
- Aug 17. Batteries on Morris Island begin bombarding Fort Sumter
- Aug 22-23. Bombardment of Charleston Island by the Swamp Angel (a battery on Morris Island)
- Aug 23. Batteries on Morris Island switch bombardment to Fort Wagner.
- Sept 7. Confederates abandon Fort Wagner
- Sept 9. Union forces attempt and fail to retake Fort Sumter

It seems that the battles break down into the following periods

- July 10-11: First Battle of Fort Wagner (SC005)
- July 16: Battle of Grimball's Landing (SC006)
- July 18: Second Battle of Fort Wagner (SC007)
- (July 19) Aug 17 - Sept 8. Second Battle of Charleston Harbor =
  Siege of Fort Wagner/Sumter ending with the Confederate abandonment
  of Fort Wagner. (SC008)
- Sept 9 : Second Battle of Fort Sumter (Failed Assault)
- Continued siege??  (SC009)

Thus, confusingly:

- SC009: Charleston Harbor is the `Second Battle of Fort Sumter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Fort_Sumter>`__ .
- SC008: Fort Sumter is the  `Second Battle of Charleston Harbor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Charleston_Harbor>`__ .
