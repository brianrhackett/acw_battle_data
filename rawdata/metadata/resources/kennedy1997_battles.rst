Kennedy (1997) battle data

Data from

    Frances H. Kennedy and the Conservation Fund (1998) "The Civil War
    Battlefield Guide", http://books.google.com/books?id=qHObJArDHZMC.

The battles in this source correspond to the CWSAC battles and have use
the same identifiers. However, in a few cases, casualty totals for
several battles are aggregated.

Although Kennedy largely follows the CWSAC battle definitions, there are
a few differences:

- In several battles, although the descriptions and battle-level data are separate, the
  casualties are combined.

  -  VA031 includes VA030, VA031
  -  VA032 includes VA033, VA033, VA035
  -  VA038 includes VA036, VA037, VA038

-  VA112 "Battle of St. Mary's Chuch" is VA066 in CWSAC.

Corrections:

-  The casualties for US and CS forces were inverted for TX005.
