<p>
<b>Significance:</b> Maj. Gen. T. J. Jackson's decisive victory
over a small Union force at Front Royal on 23 May 1862, forced
the main Union Army at Strasburg under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P.
Banks into abrupt retreat.  Jackson deceived Banks into believing
that the CS army was in the main Valley near Harrisonburg;
instead he had marched swiftly north to New Market and crossed
Massanutten via New Market Gap to Luray.  The advance to Front
Royal placed Jackson in position to move directly on Winchester
in the rear of the Union army.  On 24 May, Banks retreated down
the Valley Pike to Winchester, harassed by CS cavalry and
artillery at Middletown and Newtown (Stephens City), setting the
stage for the battle of First Winchester the following day.
<p>
The action at Front Royal demonstrated Jackson's use of Valley
topography and mobility to unite his own forces while dividing
those of his enemies.  At a minimal cost, he forced the
withdrawal of a large Union army by striking at its flank and
threatening its rear.  The confusion engendered by Jackson's
appearance at Front Royal and the hasty Union retreat from
Strasburg to Winchester contributed materially to the defeat of
Banks' army at First Winchester on 25 May.  Jackson used his
cavalry to good advantage at Front Royal, to sever US
communications east and west, and to strike the final blow at
Cedarville.

<p><p>
<H2>Description of the Battle</H2>
<p><p>
<b>Prelude:</b> On 21 May 1862, the US army under Maj. Gen.
Nathaniel P. Banks, numbering about 9,000 men, was concentrated
in the vicinity of Strasburg with two companies of infantry at
Buckton Depot.  Col. J. R. Kenly commanded 1,063 men and two guns
at Front Royal.  CS cavalry under Col. Turner Ashby confronted
Banks near Strasburg, but then withdrew to join the main army
which crossed Massanutten Mountain via New Market Gap to reach
Luray.
<p><p>
On 22 May, Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's Army of the Valley
(about 16,500 men) advanced along the muddy Luray Road to within
ten miles of Front Royal.  Jackson's headquarters were at Cedar
Point.  Colonel Thomas Munford's cavalry regiment was sent east
to close off Manassas Gap and cut communication between Front
Royal and Washington.
<p><p>
<b>Phase One.  CS Advance:</b> On the morning of 23 May, the
vanguard of Jackson's army reached Spangler's crossroads (present
day Limeton).  Here the CS cavalry under colonels Ashby and
Flournoy diverged west to cross the South Fork Shenandoah at
McCoy's Ford.  The infantry continued to Asbury Chapel and right
onto a cross road to reach Gooney Manor Road.  Following this
road, they approached Front Royal from the south, bypassing
Federal pickets stationed near the river on the Luray Road one
mile south of the courthouse.  After minor skirmishing the
Federals withdrew.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Two.  Deployment of Forces:</b> Jackson's leading
brigade, Taylor's, deployed on Prospect Hill and along the ridge
to the east.  The 1st Maryland and Wheat's Louisiana battalion
were thrown out in advance, entering the town and clearing it of
US skirmishers.  Col. J. R. Kenly, in command of US forces,
withdrew his force to Camp (Richards') Hill, supported by a
section of artillery.  The US line extended in an arc from the
South Fork to Happy Creek, defending the South Fork bridge. 
Kenly's artillery opened fire and slowed the CS advance.  Kenly's
headquarters were in the Vanoort House.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Three.  US Defense of Camp Hill:</b> The Confederate
infantry advanced through town, deploying into line of battle
under an accurate artillery fire.  A CS flanking column moved to
the east, crossing Happy Creek in an attempt to force US
withdrawal without a frontal assault.  After a long delay because
of the muddy roads, a battery of rifled artillery was deployed on
or near Prospect Hill to counter the Union guns on Camp Hill.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Four.  Skirmish at Buckton Depot:</b> In the meantime,
after crossing the South Fork at McCoy's Ford, Ashby's and Lt.
Col. Flournoy's (6VA) cavalry rode via Bell's Mill and Waterlick
Station to reach the US outpost at Buckton Depot.  Ashby made a
mounted assault, which cost him several of his best officers
before the US defenders surrendered.  Ashby cut the telegraph
lines, severing communication between the main US army at
Strasburg and the detached force at Front Royal.  He then divided
the cavalry, sending Flournoy's regiment east toward Riverton to
threaten Kenly's rear.  Ashby remained at Buckton Depot astride
the railroad to prevent reinforcements from being sent to Front
Royal.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Five.  US Retreat:</b> On discovering that Confederate
cavalry was approaching from the west, Col. Kenly abandoned his
position on Camp Hill, retreated across the South and North Fork
bridges, and attempted to burn them.  He positioned part of his
command at Guard Hill, while the Confederates ran forward to
douse the flames, saving the bridges.  While CS infantry repaired
the bridges for a crossing, Flournoy's cavalry arrived at
Riverton and forded the river, pressing Kenly's forces closely. 
As soon as the CS infantry crossed, the US position could be
flanked by a column moving along the river.  Kenly chose to
continue his withdrawal, his outmatched cavalry fighting a rear
guard action against Flournoy's 6th Virginia Cavalry.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Six.  US Surrender:</b> Kenly withdrew along the
Winchester turnpike beyond Cedarville with Flournoy's cavalry in
close pursuit.  General Jackson rode ahead with the cavalry, as
CS infantry began to cross the rivers.  At the Thomas McKay
House, one mile north of Cedarville, Kenly turned to make a
stand, deploying on the heights on both sides of the pike. 
Flournoy's cavalry swept around the US flanks, causing panic. 
Kenly fell wounded, and the US defense collapsed.  More than 700
US soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered.
<p><p><hr><p><p>
<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Many terrain features associated with this battle have been
overwhelmed by the growth of the City of Front Royal.  At the
time of the battle, Front Royal was a small village of several
streets clustered around the courthouse.  Troops maneuvered among
the buildings and on open ground, south, east, and north of the
village, areas which have now been urbanized.  Loss of integrity
is most obvious when attempting to understand maneuvers in and
around Camp (Richardson's) Hill.  It is difficult to find a
vantage point to understand the terrain advantage of the US
position there.  Camp Hill itself, site of Kenly's defense, is
densely residential (Warren Park subdivision).  Open ground east
of Camp Hill and Happy Creek would enable some understanding of
CS flanking maneuvers although access is restricted.
<p><p>
The massive reshaping of Guard Hill, due to road-widening and
quarrying, and heavy construction north to I-66 is an obvious
loss.  The current ``gap'' in Guard Hill for US 340/522 is
largely a modern cut.  Large industrial structures, including the
DuPont Automotive plant, have been constructed in the vicinity of
Cedarville on ground maneuvered over in the closing phase of the
battle.
<p><p>
In spite of these losses, several features, primarily
architectural, remain by which the flow of the battle may be
interpreted.  The hamlet of Spangler's Crossroads (Limeton) and
the road to McCoy's Ford enable an understanding of CS cavalry
movements, preparatory to the battle.  The roads from McCoy's
Ford to Buckton Depot taken by the CS cavalry pass through a
scenic rural countryside.  The site of Buckton Depot (and a depot
building, vintage uncertain), the site of Ashby's skirmish, can
be located.  Asbury Chapel marks where the CS infantry diverged
from Luray Road to reach Gooney Manor Road.  Gooney Manor Road
passes through a scenic landscape until near the entrance to
Skyline Drive at Front Royal, where there is dense development.
<p><p>
In the town of Front Royal, Prospect Hill Cemetery maintains open
ground where the CS left flank first deployed and where artillery
was positioned.  The cemetery offers a good vantage point for
understanding the terrain and tactical movements.  Monuments to
Mosby's men and to the Warren Rifles are in Prospect Hill
Cemetery.  In a general sense, the Front Royal old town can be
considered a supporting resource, although the district is not
listed in the National Register.  The Warren Rifles museum
interprets the role of Warren County residents in the Civil War. 
A historic marker and a Confederate monument stand in front of
the courthouse.  The estate of Rose Hill, a beautiful old home,
is specifically mentioned in several battle accounts.
<p><p>
The South and North Fork bridge sites can be located.  Riverside
Farm (c. 1850) at Riverton preserves about 150 acres of open
farmland and a segment of the original alignment of the Front
Royal-Winchester turnpike.  (Stonewall Jackson is said to have
slept on the porch here on the night after the battle.) The
hamlet of Riverton dates primarily from the 1880s.  The old Guard
House stands on the hill to the west of the new road cut.  The
Robert and Jacob McKay houses (late 1700s) and the old store (c.
1860) at Cedarville provide some sense of historic character in
spite of encroaching residential development.  The Thomas McKay
House where US forces surrendered stands one mile north of
Cedarville (currently an antique store).  A large industrial
building adjacent to the house degrades the setting.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
In terms of terrain, battlefield ground within the city limits of
Front Royal has been lost.  The Riverton Corporation controls
access to Guard Hill along the river.  Heavy quarrying is
occurring on the northern and eastern slopes of the hill and on
land adjacent to the river.  Highway widening has increased the
size of the Guard Hill gap and is reshaping the ground.  Plans
being discussed to build a second span over the North Fork would
further degrade this area of low integrity.  Riverside Farm is
the last area of open farmland at Riverton.  The flood plain of
the North Fork is currently agricultural land.  An I-66
interchange has spurred commercial and industrial development
north of Guard Hill on the road to Cedarville.  The area north of
Cedarville and east of US 340 is an expanding industrial park,
currently encroaching on the US surrender area.  Adjacent to this
industrial park is an ``Inland Port'' complex centered on a
railroad terminal.
