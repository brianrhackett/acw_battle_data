<H2>2.  Geography and Strategic Importance of the Valley</H2>
<p>
The Shenandoah Valley is that portion of the Great Valley of
Virginia that is drained by the Shenandoah River and its
affluents.  The Valley extends on a southwest to northeast
bearing, from its headwaters north of Lexington to the Potomac
River, a distance of about 140 miles.  For convenience, the
Valley can be said to extend from Lexington to the Potomac River,
although the watershed in the immediate vicinity of Lexington
drains south to the James River.
<p><p>
The Shenandoah Valley is bounded on the northwest by North
Mountain, the first range of the Allegheny Mountains, and on the
southeast by the Blue Ridge, which separates the Valley from the
Piedmont region and coastal plain of eastern Virginia.  The
distance from Washington to the Blue Ridge at Snickers Gap is
about fifty-five miles; from Richmond to the Blue Ridge is about
a hundred.  At its widest, the Valley is nearly twenty-five miles
across.  North of the Potomac River, the Valley continues into
Maryland and Pennsylvania with a similar configuration, but there
it is called the Cumberland Valley, and the Blue Ridge is named
South Mountain.
<p><p>
The Shenandoah Valley encompasses two counties in West Virginia:
Berkeley and Jefferson; and seven counties in Virginia:
Frederick, Clarke, Warren, Shenandoah, Page, Rockingham, and
Augusta.  Highland County has been included in the study region
because of its intimate association with Jackson's 1862 Campaign,
even though it is beyond North Mountain.  Berkeley, Jefferson,
Frederick, Clarke, and Warren counties are referred to as the
Lower (downstream) Valley; while the counties south of Strasburg
are called the Upper Valley.
<p><p>
The Shenandoah Valley's unique feature is Massanutten Mountain, a
complex ridge that extends for some fifty miles through its
middle, from Strasburg southwest to Harrisonburg.  Throughout its
length, the Massanutten divides the Valley into two smaller
valleys, the main or Strasburg Valley, which is drained by the
North Fork Shenandoah River, and the narrower Page or Luray
Valley, drained by the South Fork Shenandoah River.  Just south
of Strasburg, the main Valley is only about five miles across,
while on the far side of the Massanutten, the Luray Valley
funnels down to a width of less than a mile and a half at the
town of Overall (antebellum Milford).
<p>
<b>Streams and Rivers</b>
<p>
From the general vicinity of Lexington, a series of small streams
flows northerly; these combine to form the South River near
Waynesboro, the Middle River near Staunton, and the North River
near Bridgewater.  The North and Middle rivers conjoin west of
Grottoes, and the South River merges a few miles downstream at
Port Republic to form the South Fork Shenandoah River.  Port
Republic marked the upstream limit for seasonal navigation of the
river, hence its name.  The South Fork flows down the Luray or
Page Valley to Front Royal.
<p><p>
The North Fork Shenandoah River arises from the many small
streams that spring from Shenandoah and North Mountain west and
south of Timberville.  The river's largest tributary--Smith
Creek--joins near Rude's Hill at Mt. Jackson.  Two other
important tributaries join farther downstream--Stony Creek at
Edinburg and Narrow Passage Creek near Woodstock.  From here the
river meanders northeast through a series of incised meanders,
known as ``Seven Bends.''  At Strasburg, the North Fork turns
abruptly east across the head of the Massanutten, where it is
joined by Cedar Creek.  At Front Royal the North and South forks
conjoin, forming the Shenandoah River proper, now several hundred
yards wide.  From Front Royal, the Shenandoah flows steadily to
the northeast along the flank of the Blue Ridge to empty into the
Potomac River at Harpers Ferry.  At the time of the Civil War,
locks on the Potomac River allowed access to the Chesapeake and
Ohio (C&O) Canal, which carried canal boat traffic to Georgetown.
<p><p>
For the last forty miles of its journey to the Potomac, the
Shenandoah River is paralleled on the west by a meandering, high-
banked stream called Opequon Creek, or simply the Opequon (Oh-
PECK-n) which arises in the vicinity of Winchester and drains the
western portion of the Lower Valley, emptying into the Potomac
River.
<p><p>
<b>Valley Turnpikes, Roads, and Gaps</b>
<p><p>
The Valley Map of cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss (produced 1862-
1863) reveals an intricate web of turnpikes and farm roads within
the Valley, reflecting its densely settled agricultural character
at the time of the Civil War.  In most places, the modern network
of State and county roads is congruent with the historic network.

The primary historic Valley highways and roads are in use today. 
<p><p>

The major northeast-southwest thoroughfare of the Shenandoah
Valley at the time of the Civil War was the Valley Turnpike,
which extended from the Potomac River at Williamsport via
Martinsburg, Winchester, Middletown, Strasburg, New Market,
Harrisonburg, Staunton, and Fairfield to Lexington.  This road is
one of the oldest and most historic transportation routes in
America.  In prehistoric times, Indians followed buffalo herds
along its route.  Later it was referred to as the Warrior Trace. 
The first settlers entered the Valley from Maryland, crossed the
Potomac River at Williamsport, Shepherdstown, and Harpers Ferry,
and followed the road south.  In the 18th century, it was part of
the Great Wagon Road, which ran from Philadelphia to the back
country of the Carolinas and the Cumberland Gap.  When it was
incorporated as the Valley Turnpike (a toll road) in the 19th
century, it had already contributed mightily to the settlement of
the American frontier.  In the 20th century, first US 11 and then
I-81 were laid out to follow its course.
<p><p>
In the 19th century, the Valley Turnpike was part of a fledgling
State transportation network of turnpikes, local roads,
railroads, and canals.  It boasted a macadamized surface that
enabled travel in wet weather.  The army that controlled this
road had the advantage of being able to move swiftly up or down
the Valley, while its enemies bogged down on the muddy side
roads.  Not surprisingly, most of the Shenandoah Valley's battles
and smaller engagements were fought somewhere along the Valley
Turnpike.  Two dirt roads ran parallel with the Turnpike for most
of the distance between Winchester and Staunton, and these roads
were used extensively in conjunction with troop movements along
the Turnpike.  The Back Road, which skirted the flank of Little
North Mountain, was known for years as the Cattle Road after the
herds that were once driven north along its route to market.  The
Middle Road traced a meandering course between the Back Road and
the Valley Turnpike.  These routes today are followed by paved
county roads.
<p><p>
The placement of the major east-west routes through the Valley
depended on the location of gaps through the Blue Ridge on the
east and through the Alleghenies on the west.  The Blue Ridge
gaps were low and relatively numerous, while only a few natural
gaps in the North Mountain of the Alleghenies allowed settlers to
penetrate farther into the interior.  Roads were built through
these gaps to carry traffic into West Virginia and to the Ohio
River.  The modern road network utilizes many of these natural
gaps.
<p><p>
Winchester was a vital transportation hub in the Lower Valley
(see <a href="svsfig8.gif">Figure 8</a>).  Including the
Valley Turnpike (sometimes known as the Martinsburg Turnpike
north of town), nine important roads or turnpikes radiated from
the city.  North of town, the Old Charles Town Road (rte. 761)
diverged from the Valley Turnpike at Stephenson's Depot, leading
to Harpers Ferry via Summit Point and Charles Town.  The
``Berryville'' turnpike (modern VA 7 east) led through Snicker's
Gap to Bluemont (antebellum Snickersville) where branches
continued to the seaport of Alexandria via Leesburg (Leesburg and
Snicker's Gap Turnpike, Leesburg and Alexandria Turnpike) and
through Aldie (Snicker's Gap Turnpike) to Fairfax Courthouse on
the Little River Turnpike.  From Winchester, the Winchester and
Berry's Ferry Turnpike (US 50 east) ran southeast through Ashby's
Gap.  The Front Royal and Gaines's Crossroads Turnpike (US 522
south) led south to the town of Front Royal.  Middle Road (rte.
628) led south to Strasburg and Cedar Creek Grade or Cedar Creek
Turnpike (rte. 622) led southwest to Cedar Creek Gap.  The North
Western Turnpike (US 50 west) left the Valley by Petticoat Gap on
its way to Romney.  Just beyond the gap, the Hardy and Winchester
Turnpike (rte. 608 south) diverged southwest to Moorefield in
Hardy County via Wardensville.  The North Frederick Turnpike (US
522 north) led west and north to Hancock, Maryland.
<p><p>
Because of its strategic location in the Lower Valley, Winchester
changed hands an estimated 72 times during the war, as the armies
repeatedly advanced and receded.  Five major battles (three at
Winchester, two at Kernstown) and many smaller engagements
(including Rutherford's Farm and Abrams Creek) were fought in the
vicinity.  
<p><p>
Front Royal, situated at the confluence of the North and South
forks of the Shenandoah River at the head of the Massanutten, was
a second important transportation node.  In addition to the
turnpikes leading north to Winchester and Berryville, roads ran
west to intersect the Valley Turnpike at Strasburg (VA 55 west),
east through Manassas Gap to join the Warrenton Turnpike at
Gainesville (VA 55 east), and southeast through Chester Gap to
Massie's Corner (US 522 south).  The Luray and Front Royal
Turnpike (US 340) led southwest through Page County along the
course of the South Fork to Luray.
<p><p>
From Luray, the New Market and Sperryville Turnpike (US 211 east)
crossed Thornton's Gap to Sperryville, where roads branched
northeast to Warrenton and southeast to Culpeper Courthouse. 
Heading west from Luray, the turnpike crossed Massanutten
Mountain to New Market, from where it continued (VA 211 and 259)
to Brock's Gap in Little North Mountain.  The Luray Road (US 340)
continued south to Waynesboro via Shenandoah, Elkton, and Port
Republic.
<p><p>
Harrisonburg, situated on the Valley Turnpike near the base of
Massanutten Mountain, was an important crossroads (See <a
href="svsfig9.gif">Figure 9</a>).  The Swift Run Gap
Turnpike (US 33 east) passed along the base of the Massanutten
via Elkton over Swift Run Gap to Gordonsville.  From
Harrisonburg, a road (US 33 west) led into the Alleghenies
through Dry River Gap to Franklin, West Virginia.  The Warm
Springs Turnpike (VA 42) led southwest into Bath County.  An
important Blue Ridge crossing in this area, which led from Port
Republic through Brown's Gap (rte. 663) to Charlottesville, no
longer carries modern traffic.
<p><p>
From Harrisonburg, the Valley Turnpike (US 11 south) continued to
Staunton where it intersected the major east-west thoroughfare of
the Upper Valley--the ``Parkersburg Road'' (US 250).  This road
actually comprised three turnpikes on its course from central
Virginia to Parkersburg, West Virginia.  From Charlottesville,
the Rivanna and Rockfish Gap Turnpike led to the gap where it
entered the Staunton and Scottsville Turnpike, leading to the
city.  From Staunton west, the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike
passed through Buffalo Gap to reach Parkersburg via McDowell and
Monterey.  Staunton's location at the intersections of the Valley
Turnpike, the Parkersburg Road, and the Virginia Central
Railroad, made it the most vital transportation center of the
Upper Valley.  It was an important supply and staging area for
Confederate armies operating in the Valley until the summer and
fall of 1864, when it was repeatedly ravaged by Union forces.
<p><p>
Deserving notice are several other Blue Ridge gaps, which are
sometimes mentioned in historic accounts.  Seven miles south of
Harpers Ferry is Keyes Gap, crossed by VA 9 from Charles Town
into Loudoun County.  Six miles farther south is Gregory's or
Wilson Gap, which is no longer in use.  Between Chester Gap and
Thornton's Gap above Luray, were two minor gaps, which are not in
use today--Gravelly Spring and Beham's gaps.  East of Waynesboro
near Rockfish Gap is a cluster of little-used gaps--Turk's,
Jarman's, and Beagle.  Farther south are Howardsville Gap, Reed's
Gap (rte. 664), and Indian or White's Gap (US 60 east), which
carries the road from Lexington and eventually to Richmond.
<p><p>
Of these many gaps, Snickers, Ashby's, Manassas, Chester, Swift
Run, Brown's, Thornton's, and Rockfish gaps are most often
mentioned in Civil War literature.
<p><p>
<b>Valley Railroads</b>
<p><p>
Crucial for understanding military operations in the Shenandoah
Valley were the railroads.  By 1860, about 1,600 miles of
railroads had been built in Virginia.  The Baltimore & Ohio
(B&O), Winchester & Potomac (W&P), and Manassas Gap railroads
traversed the Lower Valley; while the Virginia Central served the
Upper Valley.  The most important of these railroads in terms of
volume of traffic was the B&O Railroad, which ran from Baltimore
to Wheeling, West Virginia, via Harpers Ferry, Martinsburg, and
Grafton.  The B&O served as a major east-west transportation
artery for the North and remained in Federal hands on-and-off for
most of the war.
<p><p>
As a vital rail, river, and canal junction, Harpers Ferry was
occupied by the Confederacy early in the war and later served as
Union general Philip H. Sheridan's principal base of operations
for his 1864 campaign.  The Confederates raided the B&O
throughout the war at Harper's Ferry, Duffield's Depot,
Martinsburg, and elsewhere.  The B&O was severed repeatedly, but
the North's ability to repair damage and keep the trains running
outstripped the South's ability to disrupt the railroad.  When
West Virginia was admitted into the Union in 1863, the West
Virginia Panhandle (Jefferson, Berkeley, and Morgan counties) was
added to the new State in a bid to maintain control of the B&O
Railroad, even though most of the citizens of those counties
supported the Southern cause.
<p><p>
The W&P Railroad ran from Winchester to Harpers Ferry via Charles
Town, a distance of 32 miles.  Farther south, the Manassas Gap
Railroad ran 78 miles from near Mt. Jackson via Strasburg, Front
Royal, and Manassas Gap to Manassas Junction where it joined the
Orange & Alexandria Railroad (O&A).  Before the war, these
railroads carried the produce of the Lower Valley to the markets
of Baltimore and Washington.  By 1862, both the W&P and the
Manassas Gap had been thoroughly dismantled.  The Union army made
some attempt to repair these railroads in 1864 but abandoned the
effort because of the activities of Col. John S. Mosby and his
partisan rangers.
<p><p>
Serving the Upper Valley, the Virginia Central Railroad ran more
than 195 miles from Jackson's River Depot near Covington to
Richmond--via Buffalo Gap to Staunton and via Rockfish Gap Tunnel
to Charlottesville and beyond.  Between Charlottesville and
Gordonsville, the Virginia Central used the same tracks as the
O&A, enabling connections to Lynchburg and points south, or
Culpeper, Manassas, and Alexandria to the north.  From
Gordonsville, the Virginia Central continued east via Hanover
Junction to Richmond.  This railroad carried vital supplies from
the Valley to the Confederate capital (with disruptions) well
into 1864.
<p><p>
Although not geographically part of the Shenandoah Valley,
Lynchburg served as a major rail and canal center, supply depot,
and hospital complex for the Confederacy.  Produce from the Upper
Valley could be shipped there by road or stream and thence to
Richmond on the James River Canal, the Southside Railroad, or the
O&A Railroad via Charlottesville and Gordonsville.  The Southside
Railroad linked Richmond with the western Confederacy through its
connections with the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad.  The
Southside Railroad continued to supply Richmond, with
interruptions from Federal raiders, until the Battle of Five
Forks (1 April 1865).
