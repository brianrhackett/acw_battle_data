<p>
<B>Significance:</B> The battle of Cedar Creek dealt the crushing
blow to the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley and, together
with William T. Sherman's successes in the Atlanta Campaign,
spurred the reelection of President Abraham Lincoln.  The battle
can be ranked in size and intensity with the battle of Opequon
(Third Winchester) and both are included among the major battles
of the Civil War.  The Confederate surprise attack at Cedar Creek
is considered one of the most daring and successful maneuvers of
its kind and is studied by military theorists today.  It was a
feat ``unduplicated'' during the Civil War.  General Sheridan's
arrival on the field of battle to rally his broken troops passed
into American verse and folklore as ``Sheridan's Ride,'' and
offers a dramatic example of the effect of charismatic
leadership.  Rarely have the scales of victory and disaster swung
to such extremes during battle: the morning's brilliant
Confederate success was transformed into a Union victory by day's
end.
<p><p><hr><p><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  US Dispositions Behind Cedar Creek:</B> The Union
Army of the Shenandoah, about 32,000 men under Maj. Gen. Philip
H. Sheridan, encamped on the heights above Cedar Creek from near
Middle Marsh Brook to south of the Valley Turnpike.  On the night
of October 18-19, General Sheridan was at Winchester, returning
from a conference in Washington, D.C.  In his absence, Maj. Gen.
Horatio Wright, commander of the VI Corps, was left in command of
the army, his headquarters at Belle Grove, south of Middletown. 
The army comprised three infantry corps (Wright's VI, Maj. Gen.
William Emory's XIX, and Brig. Gen. George Crook's Army of West
Virginia), and a cavalry corps commanded by Maj. Gen. Alfred
Torbert.  The VI Corps was on the far right of the Union infantry
on the hills north of Meadow Brook.  Torbert's cavalry (Brig.
Gen. Wesley Merritt's Division), encamped near Nieswander's Fort.

Brig. Gen. George A. Custer's division covered the Back Road and
the Cedar Creek crossings in the vicinity of Hite's Chapel.  The
XIX Corps occupied the bluffs above Cedar Creek, extending from
Meadow Brook to the Valley Pike bridge.  Crook's corps and an
attached ``provisional'' division under Brig. Gen. John Howard
Kitching were bivouacked south and east of the Valley Pike.  The
vast trains of the army were parked on level ground west of Belle
Grove near the pike.  Two of the three corps erected
entrenchments.  The Union left flank was considered protected by
the North Fork Shenandoah River and the rough ground in front of
the Massanutten and was lightly picketed by cavalry.  Other
elements of US cavalry covered Buckton Ford and the roads from
Front Royal.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  CS Approach and Preparations for Battle:</B> On 17
October 1864, Maj. Gen. John Gordon and topographical engineer
Jedediah Hotchkiss climbed to Signal Knob on the Massanutten to
survey the Union position behind Cedar Creek.  While there, they
formulated a daring plan to turn the Union left flank, which Lt.
Gen. Jubal A. Early approved.  After dark on 18 October, the plan
was set in motion.  Gordon's, Ramseur's, and Pegram's divisions,
(Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia) under overall command
of Gordon, marched from their entrenchments and crossed the North
Fork east of Fisher's Hill.  They followed a narrow path along
the face of the Massanutten, often in single file, and along the
Manassas Gap railroad to a spot opposite McInturff's and Colonel
Bowman's fords.  After surprising and capturing the pickets, the
divisions recrossed the North Fork, passing north on a farm lane,
past Col. Bowman's House ``Long Meadow,'' to the vicinity of the
Cooley House, where they faced to the left to form a line of
battle beyond the left flank of Crook's corps.  Gordon's column
was in position by 0400 hours.
<p><p>
In the meantime, Kershaw's and Wharton's divisions accompanied by
the army's artillery, advanced down the pike, by Spangler's Mill
and through Strasburg.  Kershaw's column, accompanied by Gen.
Early, diverged to the right on the road to Bowman's Mill Ford,
where it prepared for the dawn attack.  Wharton continued on the
pike past the George Hupp House to Hupp's Hill, where he
deployed.  The CS artillery massed on the Valley Pike south of
Strasburg to await developments at the front.  In conjunction
with these maneuvers, Brig. Gen. Thomas Rosser's cavalry division
advanced on the Back Road to Cupp's Ford. Brig. Gen. Lunsford
Lomax's cavalry division was ordered to advance on the Front
Royal-Winchester Road and then cross over to the Valley Pike in
the vicinity of Newtown (Stephens City).  Lomax did not advance
as directed.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  Surprise Attack on US Left Flank:</B> Before
dawn a heavy fog descended on the area.  At precisely 0500,
Kershaw's division fired a thunderous volley and rushed the
entrenchments of Thoburn's division (Crook), overrunning them. 
Gordon's force began to advance and a few minutes later smashed
into Brig. Gen. Rutherford B. Hayes' division (Crook) and
Kitching's provisional division.  Hayes' veterans attempted a
stand which soon evaporated as Confederates closed in on both
flanks of the disorganized units.  Union soldiers, surprised in
their camps, streamed rearward.  At the sound of firing,
Wharton's division advanced to the creek and deployed, awaiting
further developments.  The CS artillery raced to the front and
opened fire on the XIX Corps from the heights overlooking Cedar
Creek.  A detachment of CS cavalry with Gordon attempted to reach
Belle Grove, where they expected to capture Sheridan.
<p><p>
By 0530, mobs of stragglers from Crook's and Kitching's commands
streamed west across the Valley Pike, confirming the scope of the
disaster.  Emory withdrew the units that covered the turnpike
bridge and attempted to form a defensive line parallel with the
pike.  As he did so, Wharton's division crossed Cedar Creek at
Stickley's Mill and rushed the heights, capturing 7 guns.  Only
desperate action enabled the rest of the US artillery to escape. 
Colonel Thomas Wilde's brigade (Crook's corps) went into line
just east of the pike to contest the CS attack.  General Wright
directed their advance personally and was painfully wounded in
the chin.  A second US brigade under Col. Stephen Thomas (XIX
Corps) advanced to high ground about 200 yards east of the pike
and fired volley after volley into the fog, suffering heavy
casualties.  The stand of these brigades bought time for the
Union trains parked near Belle Grove to escape to the north.  The
advanced US units were steadily driven back to Belle Grove. 
Crook's corps and Kitching's command were shattered and out of
the fighting for the rest of the day.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  VI Corps and XIX Corps Resistance:</B> The VI
Corps deployed to meet the approaching assault.  While elements
of the XIX Corps reorganized on Red Hill, Ricketts's Division (VI
Corps) formed a line of battle anchored on Cedar Creek and fought
an isolated battle against Kershaw's division which furiously
attacked their line.  Wheaton's Division (VI Corps) advanced to
high ground in the fields north of Belle Grove Mansion, where
they were assaulted by Gordon.  The fog burned off and for the
first time the opposing forces could see one another clearly.  CS
batteries were brought to bear against the US line.  Kershaw
assaulted repeatedly but was repulsed.  Gradually, all US forces
in the area withdrew and retreated northeast along Middle Marsh
Brook.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.  Getty's Defense of Cemetery Hill:</B> While
fighting raged to his right, Maj. Gen. George Getty maneuvered
his division (VI Corps) toward Middletown, seeking to extend the
Union line to cover the Valley Pike.  When US forces on the right
began to withdraw, however, Getty established a defensive salient
on Cemetery Hill, supported by artillery.  General Early
concentrated against Getty's position, launching disjointed
attacks with elements of four different divisions which were
successively repulsed with heavy casualties in the area near the
Sperry House and the Ridings House.  The CS artillery massed
along the Valley Pike and concentrated a deadly fire on Cemetery
Hill.  After about an hour, Getty withdrew to join the rest of
the army which was rallying, first along the Old Forge Road and
then in a salient across the Valley Pike.  Getty's stand broke
the momentum of the CS assaults and enabled other US units to
withdraw north of the cemetery to regroup.
<p><p>
In the meantime, Custer's division, after throwing back Rosser's
feeble attempt to gain the US rear, joined Merritt on the far
left of the Union line, east of the pike and north of Middletown.

This concentration of cavalry threatened Early's right flank and
forced him to redeploy heavy force in this area.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Six.  Sheridan Arrives/ US Army Regroups:</B> About
1030, Sheridan arrived on the field after riding from Winchester.

He established his command post near the Valley Pike (vicinity of
the Dinges Farm) and began to reorganize his forces.  The VI
Corps was deployed on the left, adjacent to the Valley Pike, with
the XIX Corps on the right.  Crook's disorganized command was
placed in reserve along the pike.  In a dramatic moment, Sheridan
rode along the front of the reestablished battle line.  The men
responded with a tremendous cheer.  As skirmishing continued,
Sheridan placed a cavalry division on each of his flanks, Merritt
on the left and Custer on the right.  About 1500, he prepared to
launch a counterattack.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Seven.  CS Line Advances to Miller's Mill Road:</B>
After the US withdrawal from Cemetery Hill, Early advanced to
occupy the hill and called a halt to regroup.  He placed his
divisions in a line about two and a half miles long, just north
of Middletown, and pushed Ramseur and Kershaw forward to Miller's
Mill Road.  The CS divisions from left to right were: Gordon,
Kershaw, Ramseur, Pegram, Wharton.  As the afternoon wore on,
skirmishing continued and several probes were made of the newly
reestablished US line, but no serious fighting developed.  Early
appeared convinced that he had won the battle and that US forces
would retreat after dark.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Eight.  Cavalry Maneuvers/Collapse of CS Left:</B> About
1500 hours, Merritt advanced on the Union left, putting pressure
on the CS right flank north of Middletown.  Heavy US skirmish
lines forced CS skirmishers back on their main line along the
Miller's Mill Road and west.  Custer maneuvered into position on
the US right flank, confronting Gordon's men near Middle Marsh
Brook.  About 1530 Custer's division of cavalry and elements of
the XIX Corps advanced against the CS left flank (Gordon and
Kershaw), which was hanging in the air.  Custer continued
extending west beyond Middle Marsh Brook, thinning the CS line. 
He then launched a powerful attack that overran and scattered
Gordon's division.  The Confederate line now began to unravel
from west to east, putting additional pressure on Ramseur's
command at the center.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Nine.  Union Counterattack:</B> At 1600 Sheridan ordered
a general advance which led to fierce fighting along the front. 
Ramseur's division at the Confederate center near Miller's Mill
bore the brunt of the attacks and repulsed several, in spite of
the withdrawal of Kershaw and Gordon on his left.  Fighting raged
around the D. J. Miller House and mill until Ramseur fell
mortally wounded.  Then CS resistance in this area began to
collapse.  CS forces along the pike retreated hastily, although
in fairly good order, up the Valley Pike toward the Union camps
they had captured in the morning.  Delaying actions fought by
artillery and infantry units kept pursuing Union forces at bay. 
Merritt pressed forward with his division, pursuing closely as
Confederates retreated across Cedar Creek.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Ten.  CS Retreat to Fisher's Hill:</B> Custer's division
advanced south along Middle Marsh Brook, gaining the rear of the
Confederate army.  As the CS rout continued, Custer crossed Cedar
Creek at Hottel's Mill Ford and joined Merritt's division on
Hupp's Hill at dusk about 1830.  The cavalry advanced, pursuing
the Confederates back along the Valley Pike.  The bridge near
Spangler's Mill collapsed causing Early to lose most of his
artillery and many wagons.  The cavalry pursuit continued after
dark, ending at Fisher's Hill.  The US cavalry captured 43
cannons, more than 200 wagons, and many prisoners.  The
Confederates lost at least ten battle flags, which symbolized the
progressive disintegration of the army.
<p><p>

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
In spite of the damage wrought by interstate highway
construction, encroaching development in the vicinity of
Middletown, and a large-scale quarry along Middle Marsh Brook,
the integrity of Cedar Creek battlefield is high.  The
battlefield core is very large, extending from Hupp's Hill to
rte. 633 north of Middletown, and from the North Fork Shenandoah
to Middle Marsh Brook.  The study area encompasses the initial
Confederate position at Fisher's Hill.
<p><p>
Beginning with surviving entrenchments on Fisher's Hill, the line
of Gordon's flank march can be traced along the base of
Massanutten through a pristine natural landscape.  The fords
where Confederate infantry crossed the North Fork can be located
and waded.  The Col. Bowman and Cooley houses, which figured
prominently in the Confederate deployment, are there and in good
condition.  Union entrenchments remain on Hupp's Hill and along
Cedar Creek.  Belle Grove (Sheridan's headquarters) is preserved
by the National Trust.  Two hundred-fifty-eight acres of the
surrounding fields are held by the National Trust and the Cedar
Creek Battlefield Foundation (CCBF).  An additional 100 acres
adjacent to Cedar Creek in the vicinity of Bowman's Fort has
recently been donated to the National Trust/CCBF.  Cedar Creek
Battlefield is registered as a National Historic Landmark. The
acreage included within the landmark boundaries fairly accurately
reflects the size of the battlefield's core area.  The CCBF is
currently raising funds to renovate the historic Heater House.
<p><p>
The view from Getty's position on Cemetery Hill remains scenic in
spite of new townhouse construction at the base of the hill.  The
Historic District of Middletown is a contributing resource.  The
D. J. Miller House and the McDaniel House, where Ramseur was
mortally wounded, stand.  Undisturbed fields to the north and
east witnessed the counterattack directed by Sheridan late in the
day, although new construction has begun that may impact upon
this area.  These and related parcels allow in-depth
interpretation of the battle.
<p><p>
<p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
In recent years, the pace of subdivision and new construction in
the area has stepped up.  An industrial/business park was built
along US 11 south of Middletown (ironically, on the very ground
labelled ``Cedar Creek Battlefield'' on the USGS quadrant).  This
industrial park currently consists of three large, but low-
profile buildings, south of the Victorian house called Montvue. 
On this crest Confederate artillery massed against Cemetery Hill
and General Early established his command post, during the
battle.  These buildings are visible from many parts of the
battlefield.  Construction northeast of Belle Grove along rte.
624 would tend to degrade the viewshed of the land preserved by
the National Trust and CCBF.  A modern house is currently under
construction in this area.
<p><p>
The area between Cemetery Hill and Old Town Middletown has filled
in with townhouses and apartments in the past few years. 
Residential development has also occurred and continues adjacent
to the I-81 interchange (#77).  New construction of several large
homes on 3-5 acre lots began in early 1991 and is ongoing south
of rte. 634 and west of the Miller-McDaniel Farm (ground has
being recontoured).  This area saw severe fighting in later
phases of the battle.  Of all residential construction, this new
development is potentially the most damaging to battlefield
integrity, because it establishes a foothold in the rural
landscape west of town.  Other construction has been more or less
associated with the existing town.  Lord Fairfax College and the
new elementary school were built north of town, along US 11, on
ground separating the two final battle lines of the armies and
fought over by Wesley Merritt's cavalrymen and Gabriel Wharton's,
John Pegram's, and William Wofford's infantrymen.
<p><p>
The quarries along Cedar Creek and Middle Marsh Brook are large-
scale operations that are gradually working northeast along the
valley.  It appears that the quarry company owns land all the way
to rte. 627 and possibly beyond.  If continued north another half
mile, this quarrying will eradicate the ruins of 18th-century
Nieswander's Fort, site of Merritt's bivouac and George A.
Custer's decisive flanking attack against John B. Gordon. The
quarry works are visually intrusive from various parts of the
battlefield.
<p><p>
The battlefield south of the junction of interstate highways I-66
and I-81 does not seem immediately in jeopardy because there is
no interchange and access to the area is restricted to four
county roads.  This block of land retains very high
rural/historic integrity and contains the Colonel Bowman and
Cooley houses.
