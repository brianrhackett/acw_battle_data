<h1>CIVIL WAR SITES IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY OF VIRGINIA</h1><p>
<h2>A Regional Assessment of Fifteen Battlefields</h2><p>
<p>
<h1>PART ONE: OVERVIEW</h1><hr>

<p>
<b>1. Introduction</b><p>
<p>
In 1990, a study of Civil War sites in the Shenandoah Valley
of
Virginia was authorized by Public Law 101-628.  The study was
to
accomplish four tasks: identify significant Civil War sites
and
determine their condition, establish their relative
importance,
assess short and long term threats to their integrity, and
provide alternatives for their preservation and interpretation
by
Federal, State, and local governments, or by other public or
private entities.<p>
<p>
The time and funds available to perform this study were not
sufficient to cover all of the Shenandoah Valley's significant
Civil War historic sites.  Instead, the work focused on major
battlefields as the kind of historic site under the greatest
preservation pressures.  While the Civil War certainly did not
play out exclusively on battlefields, the latter are among the
most dramatic sites; they convey a very high level of meaning
to
all Americans and are extremely vulnerable to development,
highway construction, and visual intrusion.  Moreover,
effective
action to preserve key battlefields and interpret military
developments in the Valley can provide the conceptual
structure
around which to evaluate and preserve other sites, buildings,
and
structures significant to rounding out preservation and
interpretation of the Civil War in the Valley.<p>
<p>
To encompass both geographic and historic realities, the
Shenandoah Valley study area was defined as comprising eight
Virginia counties--Augusta, Clarke, Frederick, Highland, Page,
Rockingham, Shenandoah, and Warren.  The West Virginia
counties
of Jefferson and Berkeley, geographically and strategically
part
of the Valley, were excluded from the study by a provision of
Public Law 101-628.  Although none of the battlefields studied
was in Page County, the transportation routes that traversed
the
Luray Valley influenced military strategy throughout the war. 
Highland County was included because of its association with
Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign.  Highland is less populated
than
the Valley proper and has not experienced the same level of
growth and development.  The counties of Frederick, Clarke,
and
Warren (with Jefferson and Berkeley counties, West Virginia)
are
considered the Lower Valley, while the remaining counties make
up
the Upper Valley.<p>
<p>
The Shenandoah Valley's unique geographic, topographic, and
economic features, and its military-strategic importance,
influenced the conduct of the Civil War in Virginia and in the
Main Eastern theater.  Official records document 326 armed
conflict incidents alone in the Shenandoah Valley and this
does
not include many of the raids, ambushes, and partisan actions
that also comprised war in Valley.  As a result of historical
analysis to be described, this record of 326 notable armed
conflicts was reduced to fifteen battle events of major
significance.  The battlefields selected for the study were
associated with Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign of 1862,
the
Gettysburg Campaign of 1863, and the decisive campaigns of 1864.

These battles were Cedar Creek, Cool Spring, Cross Keys,
Fisher's
Hill, Front Royal, First and Second Kernstown, McDowell, New
Market, Opequon (Third Winchester), Piedmont, Port Republic,
Tom's Brook, First and Second Winchester.<p>
<p>
While assessing the integrity of these fifteen battlefields,
many
significant historic sites, such as houses, mills, and fords,
were located, associated with the battles, and mapped. 
Throughout the study, numerous consultations took place among
the
study staff, the Department of Historic Resources and other
State
agencies, regional planning offices, local government bodies,
preservation organizations, and local residents.  An effort
was
made to keep these parties informed of the purposes and
progress
of the study.  At the conclusion, a draft version of the
report
was circulated to solicit responses, opinions, and advice. 
Many
of the suggestions received during the public comment period
have
been incorporated into this report.  <p>
<p>
As identified by this study, battlefields are large historic
landscapes, encompassing many public and private landowners
and
local jurisdictions.  Because the fifteen battlefields vary
considerably in terms of size, ownership patterns, land use,
integrity and threats, this study concludes that no single
preservation alternative is best suited to the preservation of
all of the sites.  A balance must be achieved between the
common
linkages among the battlefields, which suggests a regional
approach, and the flexibility to treat each site in a manner
most
appropriate to it.  Solutions that emphasize private
ownership,
especially when current land use practices are compatible with
the preservation of the battlefields, should be considered
wherever possible.  It appears that a range of mutually
supportive preservation and interpretation alternatives, not
limited to the creation of one or more units of the National
Park
System, will be needed to achieve satisfactory results.<p>
<p>
It is the recommendation of the study team that no
preservation
alternatives be selected and implemented without wide
participation of local government and property owners.  This
recommendation is based on the diversity of these resources
apparent during the survey, and on the basis of comments
received
on the draft study.<hr>
