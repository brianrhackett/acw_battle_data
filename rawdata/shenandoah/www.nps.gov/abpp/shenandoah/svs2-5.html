<H2>5. Valley Battlefields: The Magnitude of Conflict</H2>
<p><p>
All of the conflicts selected for inclusion in the Shenandoah
Valley Study have been referred to by historians as battles, but
the range of comparison among these battles is so large that use
of the term ``battle'' to describe all equally could be
questioned.
<p><p>
The nineteenth- and early twentieth-century archivists who
compiled the <i>Official Records</i>, and other event lists and
chronologies used a ranking system of ``battle,'' ``engagement,''
and ``action'' based on the command structure of the forces
engaged (typically the Union forces engaged).  Rather than
providing guidance as to the size and intensity of an encounter,
these terms tell us only that: a battle was directed by the
ranking general of the military district and involved the bulk of
the forces under his command; an engagement might be directed by
a subordinate leader or involve only a portion of the armies in
the field; an action was a conflict, typically limited in scope,
that could not be easily labeled a battle or an engagement.  This
early ranking system was not designed to describe or interpret
events but to award appropriate plaudits to the commanding
officers and the units involved.
<p><p>
<a href="svsfig10.html">Figure 10</a> portrays a range of
comparison among the battlefields selected for the Shenandoah
Valley Study, ranking them according to the relative size of the
forces engaged and indicating their traditional ranking of battle
(B), engagement (E), or action (A).  The figures provided are the
best approximations that can be offered, considering the uneven
reliability of the sources.  Confederate strengths, in
particular, are often only estimated since many Confederate
records were lost.  Also, the full forces of one army or the
other were not always brought to the field and were not all
engaged.  The number of troops on the field and actively engaged
must be estimated, and existing estimates often differ widely.
<p><p>
A second way to compare battles is to rank the number of
fatalities incurred at each.  More deaths in a conflict typically
equated to determined, close-quarters fighting.  Battles of
maneuver and surprise, on the other hand, often resulted in lower
numbers of fatalities and higher numbers of captured and missing.

<a href="svsfig11.html">Figure 11</a> shows the Shenandoah
Valley battlefields ranked according to the approximate number of
fatalities. 
<p>
A third way to compare the battles is to rank attrition (total
killed, wounded, captured, and missing) of the forces engaged, a
useful measure of a battle's influence on the progress of its
campaign.  High attrition rates incurred by one side or the other
in a single battle might cripple its force and compel a retreat. 
In many cases, higher than average attrition rates resulted from
a disastrous rout by one side or the other with large numbers of
prisoners falling into enemy hands.  <a
href="svsfig12.html">Figure 12</a> provides a ranking by
estimating the combined attrition of the forces engaged.
<p>
The battles of Opequon and Cedar Creek stand out in terms of
size, fatalities, and attrition.  Although the size of
Confederate armies in the Valley remained surprisingly consistent
from 1862 to 1864, averaging 16,000-24,000 men, the size of the
Union armies increased dramatically under Sheridan's command in
1864, to nearly 40,000.  At Opequon, Sheridan outnumbered Early
2.6 to 1, and both armies were fully engaged.  Together, Opequon
and Cedar Creek accounted for nearly 52 percent of the fatalities
of the fifteen battles and 43 percent of the combined attrition. 
Considering that these two battles were fought only a month
apart, the toll, in the context of Valley warfare, is staggering.
<p>
In the six representative battles of Jackson's 1862 Campaign, the
Confederate army inflicted 393 fatalities at a cost of 367 dead
(total 760).  This ratio is near parity.  Looking at attrition,
the tally diverges more dramatically.  The Union armies suffered
about 6,400 casualties compared to Confederate losses of 2,745
(total 9,145).  Many of the surplus Union casualties were
prisoners taken at First Winchester and Front Royal.
<p>
In the six representative battles of the Early-Sheridan 1864
campaign, the Confederate army inflicted 1,587 fatalities at a
cost of 776 dead (total 2,363), a two-to-one ratio.  Overall,
however, the Union armies closed the gap somewhat, suffering
about 12,890 casualties compared to Confederate losses of 9,130
(total 22,020), a ratio of about three-to-two.  These figures
provide a useful comparison of scale between the 1862 and 1864
campaigns.
<p>
Numbers engaged, fatalities, and attrition rates are indicators
of how intensely a battle was fought.  Yet these indicators tend
to obscure the strategic significance of some of the smaller
conflicts.  While it is true that the larger battles achieved
significance by sheer firepower and weight of numbers, the
significance of a battle is best determined by its campaign
context, a context that must be carefully assessed as to its
influence on regional and national events.  Often it was the
battle that was not fought or the conflict cheaply won, that
determined the course of a campaign and the ultimate strategic
and political outcome.  Thus a battle, such as Front Royal, which
was won at little cost to Stonewall Jackson, attains a heightened
importance when examined in light of his strategy of flanking the
main Union army at Strasburg.  Jackson's tactical loss at First
Kernstown, for example, achieved strategic success by diverting
thousands of Union soldiers as reinforcements to the Valley. 
Future historians will continue to debate the relative
significance of these events.
