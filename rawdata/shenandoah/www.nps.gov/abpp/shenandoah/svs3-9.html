<B>Forces Engaged:</B> [c] Two infantry brigades (Jones and

(150k/650w/75m)<p>
<p>
<B>Significance:</B> On 5 June 1864, the US army of General David
Hunter crushed the smaller Confederate army at Piedmont, killing
the CS commander (General ``Grumble'' Jones) and taking nearly
1,000 prisoners.  Piedmont was an unmitigated disaster for CS
arms in the Valley.  The disorganized Confederates could do
nothing to delay Hunter's advance to Staunton, where he was
reinforced by Brig. Gen. George Crook's Army of West Virginia
marching from the west.  United, the US forces moved on
Lynchburg.  Hearing of Jones' defeat, Gen. Robert E. Lee first
rushed J. C. Breckinridge's division back to Rockfish Gap (7
June) and then detached the Second Corps of the Army of Northern
Virginia under Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to confront Hunter at
Lynchburg (12 June).  This detachment severely limited Lee's
ability to undertake defensive-offensive operations on the
Richmond-Petersburg lines and served to open up the Shenandoah
Valley as a second front in the 1864 fighting in Virginia.<p>
<p><hr><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  Cavalry Action at Mt. Meridian:</B> Shortly after
dawn, 5 June 1864, US cavalry advanced on the Staunton Road and
met CS cavalry under Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden at Mt. Meridian. 
The US troopers were driven back until reinforced and again
advanced to Mt. Meridian, supporting their attack with ten field
pieces.  The Confederates responded with two guns.  Imboden
continued to delay the US advance, while gradually retiring.  US
cavalry incurred about 100 casualties in the morning's action. 
Fighting occurred around Bonny Doon.  In the wake of the cavalry,
US infantry marched south from Port Republic.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  CS Deployment at Piedmont:</B> General ``Grumble''
Jones deployed his army in an ``L'' anchored on a bend of Middle
River facing north and bending south along the ridge line.  He
placed his two veteran brigades (under Col. Beuhring Jones and
Col. William H. Browne) on the left and center behind barricades
of fence rails.  His reserves, which consisted of home guards,
were drawn up in the woods just south and west of Piedmont. 
Vaughn's cavalry brigade was in position along the Cross Road
(present day rte. 778) east of Piedmont.  His line was supported
by artillery.  Jones made his headquarters in a tent in the yard
of the modern McDonald House.  (Imboden's cavalry brigade after
the morning's delaying action withdrew behind Polecat Draft near
Round Hill.)
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  US Advance to Piedmont:</B> About 1000 hours, US
cavalry drove the CS troopers back to the main infantry line at
Piedmont and then withdrew out of cannon range to await the
arrival of their infantry and artillery.  Moor's brigade arrived
first and deployed to the right of the road into the river bend. 
They were fired on by CS skirmishers.  Thoburn's brigade deployed
to the left of the road in the vicinity of the Shaver House. 
DuPont arrayed his artillery battalion on the heights confronting
the CS position.  Hunter made his headquarters in the Shaver
House.  One brigade of US cavalry was held in reserve.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  US Attacks on the Right:</B> DuPont massed 22
guns against the angle in the CS line, eventually forcing two
batteries to retire and take up a position closer to Piedmont
village.  Shortly after noon, elements of Moor's brigade (18CT)
assaulted the hill to their right front, driving out the CS
skirmishers.  Supported by a regiment of Thoburn's brigade,
Moor's entire line advanced, driving back the advanced CS line on
the northern brow of the ridge.  Jones withdrew his infantry to
barricades along Walker's Lane, reinforced his left to meet the
US charges, and launched a counterattack.  Fighting swayed back
and forth across the fields.  Hunter now reinforced Moor with
Wynkoop's cavalry brigade, fighting dismounted, and renewed his
attack.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.  US Attack on the Left:</B> While fighting raged
on the right, Col. Thoburn led three regiments through a ravine
and woods on the left and attacked across the Givens Run Valley. 
Mid-afternoon, he charged directly into a gap in the CS line that
was opened when Jones reinforced his left flank.  CS reserves
were advancing to fill the gap but Thoburn's regiment reached the
crest first, and a savage, hand-to-hand mel‚e erupted.  About
this time, Gen. Jones was killed, and the CS defense came
unraveled.  Inexplicably, the CS cavalry (Vaughn) witnessed
Thoburn's attack but did not advance.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Six.  CS Rout:</B> Pressed on the front and rear,
Confederate soldiers went streaming over the steep bluffs behind
to wade and swim the river.  All order was lost.  A nasty
skirmish was fought over possession of the ford to the rear of
the Col. Crawford House.  Stahel's US cavalry division advanced
on the far left to close in on the village by the Cross Road. 
They were met by Vaughn's and Imboden's cavalry who at last came
into play to act as rear guard.  Some CS units attempted to stand
near the Middle River Church and at New Hope, and US pursuit
gradually slackened.  The CS army lost about 900 captured.

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Piedmont battlefield is located on the Middle River in an area of
great scenic beauty.  The battle is readily interpreted from
public roads with minimal access to private lanes and farm roads.

The landscape in much of the area is similar to its appearance at
the time of the battle with some intrusions, most notably the
Wampler-Longacre experimental poultry farm.  This farm, with
about a dozen very large barns, is situated just behind a major
US artillery position and is visible from several parts of the
field.  One of the best views of the CS position is from this
farm, although access is restricted.  The site of the major US
attacks on the right is in very good condition.  Site of
Thoburn's attack on the left along Givens Run is in good
condition.  There are considerably fewer trees along the river
now than at the time of the battle.  Round Hill was a CS signal
station and anchored the far right flank of the CS cavalry.
<p><p>
The Shaver House, which was General Hunter's headquarters, is
owned by the same family as at the time of the battle.  Various
other historic structures remain, including the Finley House,
Crawford House, David Beard House (Belmont), Mt. Horeb Church,
and the old Garber barn; Bonnie Doon and Givens House in Mt.
Meridian.  Grand Caverns (Weyer's Cave) is nearby at Grottoes. 
``Jackson's Prayer Tree'' is located just north of Mt. Meridian. 
Local landowners say that Jackson conducted a prayer meeting here
in June 1862.  Jackson's headquarters were in the woods near
here. There is strong anecdotal evidence among local landowners
that burials have been unearthed on Piedmont battlefield.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Much of the northern half of the battlefield, scene of the most
severe fighting, has been placed in a county agricultural
preservation district, which restricts non-agricultural
development for seven years.  Several property owners in the core
area refused to participate in the voluntary district.  Long-time
residents state that they desire to ``keep farming forever'' and
express concern that the government might take their land to make
a national park.  The agricultural district allows intensive
poultry farming similar to the Wampler-Longacre farm, although
densities of these barns are limited by disease considerations
and may already be close to maximum density.  The southern end of
the field around the villages of Piedmont and New Hope has
attracted some new residential construction and is served by
county sewage lines.  New construction along rte. 778 east of
Piedmont or on rte. 608 between Mt. Meridian and Piedmont would
tend to degrade the battlefield's high integrity. Round Hill is a
distinctive feature of the area, dominating views from many parts
of the battlefield.
