<H2>4. Conclusion</H2>
<p>
Clearly, Alternative I (no action) consigns many of these
important sites to eventual oblivion--``a death of a thousand
cuts''--an alternative that seems to be unacceptable to most
individuals who commented on this report.  The four remaining
alternatives presented in this report suggest that a wide range
of preservation and interpretation solutions may be possible at
various locations in the Valley, while also allowing individual
owners and local governments the option not to participate.
<p>
Despite the obstacles outlined in Alternatives IV and V, creation
of a National Park unit at all or selected battlefields has
significant supporters.  Highland and Frederick counties, the
City of Winchester, and several national and regional
organizations have encouraged a Federal role in the Valley beyond
technical assistance and funding.  In some cases, acquisition of
core battlefields at all or selected sites was identified as the
preferred solution; in others, the suggested NPS role appears to
be construction of a visitor's center at one or more locations in
the Valley.  Many of these organizations and local governments
were not dissuaded by the potentially difficult management of a
park composed of several discontiguous sites, or NPS analysis
that the national significance of the Valley battlefields as a
whole would require substantial land acquisition, rather than
identification of ``representative'' sites or limited land
parcels.  Examples of NPS park units similar to these proposed
models were identified, such as Richmond National Battlefield
Park.
<p>
There appears to be significant interest in striving for new park
models, or adoption of management techniques similar to the NPS
participation in the Lakawanna Heritage Valley Plan in
Pennsylvania.  After review of this report, the National Park
System Advisory Board supported Federal, regional, and local
coordination, specifically recommending that the Service play a
role in planning and interpretation within a Partnership Park or
National Heritage Corridor framework.  Overall, the need to
develop innovative and flexible solutions to protection and
management was stressed by many who commented on the study
report.  They stressed
using the combined advantages of the private and public sectors,
in
particular, approaches (modeled after the <i>Countryside
Stewardship</i> program in England) that involve property owners
in
a contractual relationship to be responsible for maintaining some
historic resource amenity on their land.  Such approaches could
be
tested as an economical alternative to a local, State, or Federal
park unit.
<p>
In the end, new solutions must respect the integrity of the
National Park System by only creating units that are of the
highest resource quality, rather than fragments or resources that
lack sufficient integrity, national significance, and
interpretive potential.  The National Park Service, however, can
be an effective partner with the State, local, and private
sectors in collaborating on practical solutions to protecting and
presenting to the American people the crucial elements of their
history that occurred at fifteen battlefields in the Shenandoah
Valley of Virginia.<hr>
