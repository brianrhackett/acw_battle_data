<h2>Figure 19. Summary of Risk Categories and Preservation
Tools</h2>
<p>Time Frame for Action.  These recommended time frames identify
when preservation activities at the very latest should take
place.  Earlier efforts by local governments and private citizens
are appropriate and should not be discouraged.  Earlier efforts
would undoubtedly be less costly and encourage more effective
preservation regionwide.</p>
