<p>
<B>Significance:</B> This battle is considered by many historians
as the opening conflict of the famous Valley Campaign of 1862. 
It was the only battle recorded as ``lost'' by Stonewall Jackson,
but in many ways he gained as much by losing as by winning. 
After the battle, President Lincoln was disturbed by Jackson's
potential threat to Washington and redirected more than 35,000
men to defend approaches from the Valley before the campaign was
finished.  Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's army was deprived of
these reinforcements, which he claimed would have enabled him to
take Richmond during his Peninsular campaign.  Because of this
redeployment of Federal troops, First Kernstown is considered one
of the decisive engagements of 1862.
<p>
<hr><p>
<H2>Description of the Battle</H2><p>
<p>
<B>Prelude:</B> Acting on faulty intelligence that suggested that
his small army outnumbered the Federal forces at Winchester, Maj.
Gen. Thomas J. Jackson moved to strike his opponents and prevent
US reinforcements from leaving the Valley to aid McClellan's army
on the Peninsula.  The division of Brig. Gen. James Shields in
fact outnumbered Jackson more than two-to-one.  On the afternoon
of 22 March, Ashby's cavalry and horse artillery skirmished with
US forces near Kernstown.  General Shields was wounded in this
affair, his arm broken by a shell fragment, and divisional
command devolved to Col. Nathan Kimball.
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.</B>  Skirmishing at Kernstown: At dawn Kimball
moved against Ashby's advance on the Valley Pike north of
Kernstown.  Sullivan's and a portion of Kimball's US brigades
advanced, straddling the pike, and pushed Ashby south of Hoge's
Run, taking possession of Pritchard's Hill.  Ashby's troopers
formed a new defensive line, which was later supported by
infantry and maintained throughout the battle.  Jenks' US battery
unlimbered on Pritchard's Hill and responded to Ashby's artillery
in position near the Opequon Church.  About 1100 hours, Jackson's
infantry began to concentrate south of Kernstown.  It was soon
evident to Kimball that Jackson's army was arriving on the field.
Kimball consolidated his position and awaited reinforcements. 
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.</B>  CS Flank Movement: By 1400 hours, Jackson's
infantry was on the field, massed south of Kernstown.  Jackson
launched a feint toward Kimball's main position along the Pike
with a portion of Burks' brigade, but this was to disguise a
flanking movement to his left along Sand Ridge.  Jackson directed
Fulkerson's and Garnett's brigades to the ridge, leaving Burks to
support Ashby.  Confederate artillery (3 batteries) were
positioned on the eastern face of the ridge and engaged US
batteries on Pritchard's Hill.  Fulkerson advanced on the left,
seizing an east-west stone fence on the Glass farm under fire. 
Garnett came up on Fulkerson's right, extending the CS battle
line from Opequon Creek east across the front of the ridge, then
bending back south to cover the artillery.  A regiment was
deployed across the Middle Road to maintain a connection between
the CS flanks.  Recognizing the threat to his right, Kimball
moved Tyler's brigade forward from its reserve position near the
toll gate at the intersection of the Valley Pike and Cedar Creek
Grade to confront Fulkerson and Garnett.  As the artillery duel
continued, skirmishers closed and the fighting began to heat up.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.</B>  US Assault on Sand Ridge: At 1600 hours,
Tyler deployed his five regiments (about 3,000 men) and attacked
the CS position on Sand Ridge, supported by his batteries on
Pritchard's Hill and a small cavalry force on his far right
flank.  Several attempts to turn the CS left flank were repulsed
with heavy casualties.  Tyler now focused his attention on the CS
center on the crest of the ridge.  Recognizing that Ashby's
activity on the Valley Pike was a demonstration only, Colonel
Kimball marched his brigade and part of Sullivan's (about 3,000)
to the right, joining with Tyler to assault the CS center and
right on Sand Ridge.  Garnett's outnumbered brigade lacked the
protection of a stone fence like Fulkerson's and soon began to
fall back.  Jackson dispatched two regiments to the support of
Garnett but before they arrived, Garnett ordered a withdrawal,
believing his position untenable.  This movement opened
Fulkerson's right flank to a heavy fire and he too retired.  The
retreat soon became badly disorganized.  The CS artillery kept US
forces in the open ground east of Sand Ridge at bay, firing
canister, but no fire could be brought to bear along the wooded
ridge itself.  The Union advance along the crest forced the guns
to retire.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.</B>  Rear Guard Action: Jackson deployed two
regiments (5VA and 42VA) across the ridge to slow the US advance.

Several regiment-sized attacks were repulsed, and for a brief
time fighting was fierce and hand-to-hand.  According to
Henderson, colors of the 5th Ohio changed hands six times.  A
body of US cavalry advanced south along the road (rte. 621), but
were checked by Funston's cavalry.  Darkness ended the fighting.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.</B>  CS Retreat: Jackson withdrew along ``Stone
Lane'' past the Magill House and south along the Valley Pike. 
Ashby remained with the cavalry at Bartonsville, while the
infantry went on to Newtown (Stephens City).  Jackson slept in
the corner of a rail fence near Bartonsville.  US forces did not
pursue.
<p><p><hr><p>
<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The core area of the battlefield where the major Union attacks
occurred is bisected by the four-lane rte. 37-bypass, but the
western and eastern portions of the field are in relatively
pristine condition.  The western portion, scene of the most
intense fighting, is the Glass property, site of the 1840s Glass
House (in the same family).  The property preserves all of the
original land contours and remnants of stone fences that figured
prominently in the battle.  Part of the property is farmed as it
was during the Civil War, but the woodland along Sand Ridge is
more extensive now than at the time of the battle.  To the east
is Pritchard's Hill and the Pritchard-Grim property.  Pritchard's
Hill served as a Union artillery strongpoint during First
Kernstown and was the center of fighting for Second Kernstown. 
This property from rte. 628 to the historic Opequon Church and
north of rte. 652 is also in very good condition.  The area of
skirmishing on the morning of the battle along the Valley Pike
(US 11) has been claimed by industrial, commercial, and
residential developments and is lost.  Little remains of the
original hamlet of Kernstown other than Hoge's Ordinary, which
has been renovated into office space.  The area where the rear
guard action was fought on Sand Ridge is occupied by a housing
development.  The importance of this ground is enhanced by its
significance in two major Shenandoah Valley campaigns.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Land east of US 11 along the railroad tracks has been developed
for a large-scale industrial/business park.  Route 11 is zoned
commercial/industrial and has been densely developed from south
of Kernstown to the Winchester city limits, causing concern over
potential development plans west of US 11.  A county planning
official noted, however, that watershed and ground water
considerations make development in the Pritchard's Hill and Sand
Ridge areas less desirable.  These factors would need to be
considered before any development plans would be approved. 
Residential development is encroaching on the northern part of
Pritchard's Hill.  For the present, a large portion of this land
remains in private ownership and has been altered little since
the Civil War.  The Glass property has been placed in the Glen
Burnie Trust and Pritchard-Grim farm and adjacent portions of
Pritchard's Hill are owned by the Charles Hardy Grim Estate.
