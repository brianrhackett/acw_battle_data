<p><p>
<B>Significance:</B> Opequon or Third Winchester (fought 19
September 1864) was the largest and most desperately contested
battle of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley, resulting in
more than 9,000 casualties.  The battle was a turning point of
the war in the Valley, marking the rise of Sheridan and the
decline of Confederate power.  Sheridan defeated the Confederate
army again three days later at Fisher's Hill (22 September),
forcing it to retreat up the Valley to near Waynesboro.  The CS
army of Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early suffered about 23 percent
casualties.  Casualties for the larger Union army under Maj. Gen.
Philip Sheridan exceeded 5,000, nearly 20 percent.  The Union XIX
Corps sustained 40 percent casualties (2,074 men) and lost every
regimental commander during its assaults on the Middle Field and
Second Woods.  The most severe fighting and casualties occurred
in the large parcel east of I-81, north of rte. 7, west of rte.
656, and south of rte. 661.  The Middle Field ranks with some of
the most sanguinary fields of the Civil War, witnessing more than
3,000 casualties.  CS general Robert E. Rodes and US general D.
A. Russell were both killed within a few hundred yards of the
Dinkle Barn site at the entrance to Winchester Mall.
<p><p><hr><p><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  US Advance (19 September):</B> Maj. Gen. Philip
Sheridan's army advanced from the vicinity of Berryville on the
Winchester-Berryville Pike about 0200 hours, 19 September 1864. 
At earliest light, Brig. Gen. James Wilson's cavalry division
crossed the Opequon at Spout Spring and advanced through a defile
known as Berryville Canyon, followed by the US infantry (VI
Corps, XIX Corps, and Crook's corps).  At the canyon's mouth the
cavalry met the first elements of Maj. Gen. Stephen Ramseur's CS
division and drove them back on their supports.  Johnston's
brigade deployed across the pike and held back the Union advance,
while the rest of the division came into line to cover the
Berryville Pike and Senseny Road farther to the south.  The US
cavalry launched several mounted and dismounted charges, driving
the CS infantry back about 150 yards to the vicinity of the
Dinkle Barn.  Here Ramseur stiffened his defense with artillery,
and the US cavalry withdrew as its infantry began to deploy. 
Wilson's division moved to cover the US left flank where it
remained for the rest of the battle.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  Cavalry Action:</B> About 0200 hours Brig. Gen.
Wesley Merritt's cavalry division of three brigades (Custer,
Devin, Lowell) advanced toward Seiver's and Locke's fords from
the vicinity of Berryville.  Their crossings were resisted by
Brig. Gen. John McCausland's cavalry brigade dismounted behind
barricades.  The Reserve brigade (Lowell) pushed across at
Seiver's Ford against fitful opposition.  Custer's brigade met
heavier resistance at Locke's Ford and made several mounted
charges before securing a foothold on the western bank.  By 0800
hours both wings were across the creek, but the cavalry did not
advance for several hours.  About 1030 hours, McCausland's
skirmishers withdrew, and Merritt's division moved cautiously
forward.  Waiting for them was Wharton's infantry division about
a mile west of the fords, deployed across the roads in woods and
behind stone fences.  About 1100 hours, the US cavalry began
testing the CS defenses with skirmishers and artillery.  Custer
launched one mounted attack but was quickly repulsed.  About
noon, Sheridan's main infantry attack was underway, and Wharton's
division withdrew to cover the CS left flank on the Valley Pike
north of Winchester.  Merritt continued forward along Charles
Town Road.  Custer followed the line of the Winchester & Potomac
Railroad.  About 1400 hours Merritt's division converged with
Averell's cavalry division on the Valley Pike near Stephenson's
Depot.  (See phase seven.)
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  Deployment of US Infantry:</B> In the meantime,
the Union infantry bogged down in the narrow confines of
Berryville Canyon, dashing Sheridan's hopes of quickly taking
Winchester and defeating the CS army in detail.  Maj. Gen.
Horatio Wright's VI Corps of three divisions (Getty, Ricketts,
Russell) emerged from the canyon in order.  Getty's division
deployed south of the pike with its left flank resting on Abrams
Creek.  Ricketts' division formed north of the pike on Getty's
right and extending to Redbud Run.  Russell's division was held
in reserve.  The XIX Corps of two divisions (Dwight and Grover)
did not begin crossing until after 0900 hours and eventually
deployed north of the pike into the First Woods, connecting with
Ricketts' right.  Sheridan established his headquarters near the
Berryville Pike, probably south of the road on the Eversole Farm.
<p><p>
As the US infantry deployed, the CS batteries opened a furious
fire from behind the Dinkle Barn.  Union batteries swung into
action on both sides of the pike to engage the CS guns.
<p><p>
     In the meantime, Lt. Gen. Jubal Early concentrated his
scattered divisions.  Rodes' division, marching from near
Stephenson's Depot, deployed to the left and rear of Ramseur's
division in the West Woods.  Gordon's division extended the line
across the Hackwood Farm to Redbud Run.  Wharton's infantry and
Fitz Lee's cavalry division drew a line across the Valley Pike
north of town near Stephenson's Depot.  CS batteries deployed on
high ground along Baker Lane north and south of the West Woods,
and north of Redbud Run.  Skirmishing continued along Ramseur's
front.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  Fighting in Middle Field:</B> At 1140 hours, a US
signal gun boomed and Grover's division of four brigades (Birge,
Molineux, Sharpe, and Shunk) launched its attack from the First
Woods across Middle Field toward the Second Woods behind which
Gordon's division waited.  CS horse artillery north of Redbud Run
played havoc with the flanks of Grover's attacking line.  Birge's
brigade reached the woods, driving back skirmishers, but then
came up against Gordon's main line and were staggered.  Sharpe's
brigade came up on Birge's left, and the fighting became
desperate.  The Confederate line broke, falling back across the
Hackwood property.  Seven CS cannon in the Hackwood Lane fired
canister pointblank into the US attackers, throwing them back. 
Gordon now launched a counterattack with two brigades, driving
Birge and Sharpe out of the Second Woods and back across Middle
Field.  Grover ordered Molineux to advance and plug the gap that
had opened between Birge and Sharpe.  The firing was so intense
that Molineux's flanks seemed to ``melt away.'' Shunk's brigade
was thrown forward to bolster the wavering Union line, coming in
on Molineux's right rear.  Shunk closed to within sixty yards of
the CS line in the Second Woods.  The two lines delivered
pointblank volleys into each others' ranks.  Gordon again
counterattacked, and the Union attack collapsed.  The wreckage of
Grover's division went streaming back across the Middle Field to
the safety of the First Woods.  The CS horse battery (Breathed)
north of Redbud Run again worked execution among the retreating
division.  Every regimental commander in Grover's division was
killed or wounded; casualties totaled nearly 1,500.  Beal's
brigade of Dwight's division deployed in the treeline at the east
end of the Middle Field and advanced into ``that basin of Hell''
to stem the retreat.  Gordon's men waiting along the treeline of
the Second Woods laid down a murderous fire.  The Union brigade
did not reach within 200 yards of the Second Woods before being
pinned down.  They expended all of their ammunition before
retreating back to the First Woods.  The 114th New York suffered
casualties of 60 percent (188 of 350 effectives).  McMillan's
brigade, personally directed by Corps commander Maj. Gen. William
Emory, advanced.  They reached a shallow ravine about 200 yards
from the Second Woods, where two regiments (8VT and 12CT) clung
on for nearly two hours.  By 1300 hours, the main thrust of the
XIX Corps attack was blunted and its ranks decimated.  By 1400
hours, firing on this end of the field sputtered out from sheer
exhaustion.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Five.  Fighting Near Dinkle Barn:</b> At 1140 in
conjunction with the XIX Corps' advance on the right, Getty's and
Ricketts's divisions of the VI Corps launched their attack
against Ramseur's line, which was positioned on high ground,
stretching from the Dinkle Barn south behind Abrams Creek. 
Ricketts' division on the right was ordered to guide its attack
on the Berryville Pike, which takes a sharp jog to the left in
front of the Dinkle Barn.  As they advanced, a gap widened
between the VI Corps and the XIX Corps on the far right. 
Keifer's and Emerson's brigades ruptured the Confederate center
at the Dinkle Barn and moved to capture a battery of artillery in
front of the West Woods.  Ramseur's left flank now gave way and
Confederates began to drift back toward Winchester.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Six.  Rodes's Counterattack:</b> Just as Ramseur's left
flank gave way from the Union attacks, Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes
brought his division forward from its protected position in the
West Woods.  About 1330 he launched a devastating counterattack
into the gap that had opened between the VI and XIX Corps. 
Battle's Alabama brigade ``came out of the woods like a
whirlwind,'' crushing Ricketts's division, which formed the right
flank of the VI Corps.  About this time, General Rodes was killed
by shrapnel.  He fell somewhere along the woods line.  Union
soldiers streamed back along the Berryville Pike, while two US
batteries astride the pike tried to slow the CS assault.  From
his command post on Eversole's Hill, Sheridan and Wright
witnessed the disaster.  Sheridan immediately committed his
reserves to stave off certain defeat; this was David A. Russell's
division of three brigades (Campbell, Upton, and Edwards). 
Campbell advanced his brigade astride the Berryville Pike with
Edwards' brigade to his right.  General Russell, directing these
maneuvers, was mortally wounded.  The two brigades struck
Battle's attackers head-on and stalled them in the ravine from
which they had emerged and drove them back on their supports at
the edge of the West Woods--the rest of Rodes' division.  Upton's
brigade came in on Edwards' right advancing from the edge of the
Second Woods.  The two divisions--Rodes' and Russell's--closed,
exchanging murderous volleys.  Upton's impetuous charge stopped
the CS counterattack and drove it back into the West Woods. 
Russell's division was then withdrawn out of range to regroup. 
Wright called Upton's attack the turning point of the battle.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Seven.  Cavalry Action:</b> Concurrent with the above
events, there was cavalry fighting along the Valley Pike north of
Winchester.  About 0500 hrs. the Union cavalry division of
William Averell crossed the Opequon near Darkesville and moved to
the Valley Pike, steadily pushing back the 23rd Virginia Cavalry,
which fought a delaying action back to Bunker Hill.  There the
23VA were reinforced by the 62nd Virginia mounted infantry.
<p><p>
About 10 o'clock, Union cavalry attacked at Bunker Hill,
forcing the CS cavalry to retire.  Averell continued pushing
south on the pike to link up with Merritt's division about 1400
hours, near Stephenson's Depot.  South of the old Charles Town
road, the Confederate cavalry units were stiffened by Smith's
infantry brigade (Wharton's Division).  About 1330, Devin's
brigade arrived on the road to the depot.  About one mile south
of the depot, it encountered McCausland's brigade drawn up in
line of battle and attacked, driving the Confederates back in
confusion.  The 23VA cavalry and the 62VA mounted infantry
attacked the Union flank disrupting the charge.  McCausland and
Smith retired one mile to the lightly entrenched line at near
Collier Redoubt where they were reinforced by Fitz Lee's two
brigades (Wickham and Payne) and Wharton's infantry division. 
Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee fell wounded, during the fighting south of
Stephenson's Depot.  The Union cavalry deployed five brigades in
line of battle, stretching from the railroad west toward the
ridge near the intersection of the Valley Pike and Welltown Road.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Eight.  Crook's Flank Attack:</b> About 1300 hours,
Sheridan directed Crook's corps of two divisions (Thoburn and
Duval) to advance from its reserve position near Spout Spring. 
The divisions marched to near the ``Factory'' on Redbud Run,
where they split up.  Thoburn's division moved west on the south
bank of Redbud into the First Woods to relieve the XIX Corps. 
Duval's division crossed the run and turned west accompanied by
the artillery of Capt. Henry DuPont.  Duval's division deployed
near the Huntsberry House.  DuPont unlimbered 18 guns on what has
been named DuPont Hill, opposite Gordon's flank in the Second
Woods and opened fire.  Crook now ordered Duval's division
forward into a ``wall of flame.'' They swept across Redbud Run at
the Hackwood House, turning Gordon's flank and advancing against
Wharton's line, stretching from Collier Redoubt east.  About this
time, Thoburn's division charged out of the First Woods into the
Middle Field.  This two-pronged assault forced Gordon to abandon
the Second Woods and align himself with Breckinridge to his left
rear.  The CS line was now drawn into a compact L-shape, anchored
by cavalry at Star Fort.  Wharton's division faced north. 
Gordon's division made the turn of the L and Rodes' and Ramseur's
divisions extended the line south to Abrams Creek.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Nine.  Collapse of CS Line:</b> With the success of
Crook's attack on the right, Sheridan ordered a general advance
against the constricted CS position on the plateau just north and
east of the town.  The Confederates were posted behind stone
fences, rail barricades, and in shallow earthworks constructed in
1862.  They could retreat no farther without losing organization
in the streets of Winchester.  As the Union advance closed from
east and north, firing became fierce and desperate.  The massed
artillery of both sides fired case shot and canister.  General
Sheridan rode forward to the battle lines to urge his troops
forward.  About 1530 hours, as the infantry fighting reached a
crescendo, Averell and Merritt advanced their cavalry divisions
astride the Valley Pike, first at a walk and then at a thundering
gallop.  They swept over the CS line at Collier Redoubt driving
back the CS cavalry on the low ground below Star Fort. 
Schoonmaker's brigade of Averell's division repeatedly attacked
Munford's cavalry at Star Fort, eventually overrunning the work. 
The CS infantry withdrew to another line about 150 yards to the
rear but the damage was done.  The sound of Union cavalry
pounding in their rear spread panic all along the Confederate
line, and soldiers began streaming to the rear and ``whirling
through Winchester.'' Wharton's and Gordon's divisions seemed to
disintegrate.  Seven Federal horseman captured Confederate battle
flags, each earning a Medal of Honor.  Rodes's division
(commanded now by Grimes) performed the difficult maneuver of
``changing front'' to the north to stop the onrushing US cavalry.
Early's army retreated in disorder.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Ten.  Rear Guard Actions:</b> General Early fashioned a
defensive line at Kernstown (probably at Pritchard's Hill and
behind Hoge's Run) which saved his wagons and most of his
artillery.  Cavalry and elements of the VI Corps probed this
makeshift CS defense as night fell, but the US forces were too
disorganized by success to mount an effective pursuit.  After
dark, the CS army withdrew up the Valley Pike to Fisher's Hill
south of Strasburg.  Gen. Sheridan established his headquarters
in Winchester at the home of Lloyd Logan.  Casualties were so
severe that nearly every sizeable structure in Winchester served
as a hospital after the battle.
<p><p><hr><p><p>
<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The Opequon battlefield is large and sprawling, covering
thousands of acres east and north of Winchester.  In general,
much of the battlefield has been greatly degraded or destroyed by
the expanding urban environs of Winchester, but several
significant parcels currently remain, perhaps 800-900 acres:
these include the Cavalry Field north of Collier Redoubt, the
Hackwood Estate, northern half of Middle Field and First Woods
adjacent to Redbud Run, and the heights (including DuPont's Hill)
north of Redbud Run.  Together, these parcels form a block of
battlefield core that retains a high degree of integrity. 
<p><p>
Many historic structures remain in the vicinity, including
Hackwood; Spout Spring (Wood House) on rte. 7 adjacent to a
sewage treatment plant; an old house, mill site, and a dye house
where rte. 656 crosses Redbud Run; an old log house where rte.
659 crosses Redbud Run; Brumley House; Valley Mill Farm; Jordan
Springs; Tanquary House; and others.  The Hackwood Estate dates
from 1777 and is a historic treasure in its own right. 
Preservation of this house and parcel alone would allow
substantial interpretation of the battle of Opequon.
<p><p>
Other parcels, such as the Opequon Crossing and Spout
Spring, Seiver's and Locke's fords, and the Second Winchester
parcel at Stephenson's Depot (which was scene of cavalry actions
during this battle) would expand interpretation.  Star Fort and
Collier Redoubt appear protected, although without sufficient
buffers.
<p><p>
Although hemmed in by development and severely degraded, the
Dinkle Barn site adjacent to the I-81 entrance ramp off rte. 7 is
key to understanding the attack of the VI Corps and Rodes'
counterattack.  A portion of the ravine down which Rodes attacked
is intact northeast of I-81 interchange in front of the Dinkle
Barn site at the entrance of Winchester Mall.  The battery
heights west of I-81 are being developed for business,
industrial, and residential uses.  The last surviving parcel of
West Woods (adjacent to I-81) is currently being bulldozed for
townhouses.
<p><p>
The Hastings marker is the only monument erected on the
battlefield that remains.  It is enclosed by an iron fence and
sits next to the road in the midst of Fort Collier
Business/Industrial Park east of Collier Redoubt.  Nearby are the
remains of old stone fences and an old farm lane defended by CS
troops in the battle's later phases.  
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Threats are immediate and of large order.  If continued as
planned, the residential development of Caleb Heights and
associated development would destroy the last remaining intact
parcels of the infantry fighting at the battle of Opequon. 
According to county-approved plans, construction would occupy
most of the area south of Redbud Run with more than 600 single
family homes, townhouses, and a commercial strip.  A connector
road would be pushed through from the north, separating Hackwood
and DuPont's Hill.  As of this writing, construction has not
begun and has been held up by financial transactions.
<p><p>
The Hackwood House and property (144 acres) was recently
offered for auction but the sale was postponed.  This property
could potentially be subdivided.  Regency Lakes subdivision was
built several years ago on southern portions of Middle Field and
First Woods.  Further phases of housing development, if
constructed, would cover the last portion of Second Woods,
``Rodes' Ravine,'' and another segment of the First Woods.  Star
Fort itself is owned by a Civil War reenactment group but the
surrounding 50-acres is for sale and zoned commercial/industrial.
<p><p>
The Shenandoah Valley Civil War Foundation, a local
preservation group, has negotiated to preserve a small portion of
the Second Woods area as a park if development proceeds.  The
developer, Top of Virginia Corporation, has agreed to set aside
63 acres in the area adjacent to Hackwood as a commemorative
park.  A forty-acre parcel of Middle Field next to Redbud Run is
privately owned; the owner has stated in the past that he will
not develop it.
