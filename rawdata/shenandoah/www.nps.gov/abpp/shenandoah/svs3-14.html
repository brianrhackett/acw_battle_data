<p>
<B>Significance:</B> Tom's Brook was a battle of strategy and
maneuver that pitted cavalry against cavalry.  The CS cavalry
were eager for revenge against the US cavalry, which had been
burning barns and mills in the Valley for the previous week.  On
9 October 1864, however, Sheridan ordered his cavalry to ``whip''
the enemy or get whipped themselves.  In the resulting conflict,
the US troopers routed the CS cavalry, impairing its morale and
efficiency for the remainder of the campaign.  The CS flight was
referred to by Valley residents and victorious Union troopers as
the ``Woodstock Races.'' The fighting on the Back Road at
Spiker's Hill pitted two former West Point roommates against one
another--Tom Rosser and George Armstrong Custer.  Maj. Gen.
Philip H. Sheridan watched the battle unfold, reputedly from the
summit of Round Hill.<p>
<p><hr><p><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2><p>
<p>
<B>Phase One.  Disposition of Forces:</B> On 8 October 1864, the
Confederate Cavalry under overall command of Maj. Gen. Thomas
Rosser harried the withdrawing US cavalry on the Valley Pike and
the Back Road, fighting a brisk skirmish along Tom's Brook near
the Back Road.  The CS cavalry were enraged by the destruction of
the Valley they had witnessed in the last week and were
attempting to arrest further destruction.  Rosser had been
dispatched to the Valley from Petersburg to command the CS
cavalry and had generally been hailed by the local populace as
the ``Savior of the Valley.'' At dark, Rosser halted his division
of three brigades (about 2,500 men) on the Back Road in the
vicinity of Spiker's Hill and pushed skirmishers beyond Tom's
Brook to Mt. Olive.  The Middle Road was covered by a force of
observation of unknown size.  Maj. Gen. Lunsford Lomax's Division
of two brigades and a battery of horse artillery (about 1,000
men) bivouacked on both sides of the Valley Pike behind Jordon
Run just south of the hamlet of Tom's Brook. 
<p><p>
Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's US cavalry division (about 3,500
men) under overall command of Brig. Gen. Alfred Torbert encamped
at the base of Round Hill. Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer's
division of two brigades (about 2,500), bivouacked ``behind
Tumbling Run'' northeast of Mt. Olive on the Back Road.  Upset by
Rosser's aggressive tactics of the previous days, army commander
Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan ordered Torbert to move at daylight
of 9 October and ``whip the rebel cavalry or get whipped
himself.'' 
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  US Advance on Valley Pike:</B> Torbert planned to
bring an overwhelming force against Rosser's division on the Back
Road while holding Lomax's division at bay with a reinforced
brigade on the Valley Pike.  Lomax's main battle line was
deployed behind Jordon Run on both sides of the Valley Pike,
supported by six guns.  His front line was dismounted, while he
maintained a strong mounted reserve on the pike.
<p><p>
At dawn, Lowell's brigade (Merritt) advanced to Tom's Brook
on the Pike, deployed, and pushed forward ``one-quarter of a
mile'' where it found Lomax's main line, dismounted behind Jordon
Run.  The CS line was supported by six guns placed on either side
of the Valley Pike and a strong mounted reserve.  While Lowell
was engaged, Kidd's brigade rode north along Tom's Brook to
connect and cooperate with Custer.  Devin's brigade followed but
veered off on the Harrisville Road (or overland) and advanced to
the vicinity of St. Johns Church, maintaining a connection with
the force on the Valley Pike and at the same time extending a
skirmish line to connect with the Kidd's brigade on the right.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  Custer's Advance/ Fighting on Back Road:</B>
Rosser dismounted most of his troopers behind Tom's Brook at the
base of Spiker's Hill behind stone fences and rudimentary
fieldworks (his brigades from left to right, Munford, Payne, and
the Laurel brigade).  Rosser's six guns unlimbered along the
crest of Spiker's Hill slightly behind a second line of
barricades.  A mounted reserve was maintained on the ridge; the
right was extended toward the Middle Road with mounted
skirmishers.
<p><p>
Advancing beyond Mt. Olive, Custer pushed forward three
regiments of dismounted skirmishers against the main CS position.
Three other regiments and Wells' brigade were kept mounted and
maneuvered for position behind the skirmish line.  A battery of
artillery unlimbered on the hill in front of present-day St.
Matthews (or Sand Ridge) Church and engaged the Confederate
artillery on Spiker's Hill.  When Kidd's brigade made contact
with Custer's left, Custer extended his right flank along the
shoulder of Little North Mountain, supporting the movement with a
battery.  Kidd deployed over the hill, driving Rosser's
skirmishers before him, and unlimbered another battery to
enfilade the CS position.  The Confederate line was gradually
forced back into a horseshoe around the front of Spiker's Hill. 
A regiment of US cavalry (probably of Devin's brigade), moving on
the Middle Road from Harrisville arrived on a hill overlooking
Sand Ridge Road (intersection of Middle Road) and to the right
and rear of Rosser's main force.  Reacting to this threat, Rosser
ordered a withdrawal.  His men raced to mount their horses.  At
this point, Wells brigade attacked Spiker's Hill up the Back
Road, taking few casualties.  At the crest, Wells encountered
Munford's brigade and a mounted mel‚e ensued.  Rosser's force
retreated, partly down Back Road to Pugh's Run, partly on Sand
Ridge and Middle roads toward Woodstock.  Custer's and Kidd's
troopers pursued.  General Sheridan is said to have watched the
action from Round Hill, where there was a US signal station
during the battle.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  Fighting on the Valley Pike:</B> In the meantime,
fighting continued along the Valley Pike.  Lowell's brigade drove
CS pickets back to Jordon Run and deployed on both sides of the
pike.  The 1st Michigan (Kidd's brigade) supported Lowell's right
flank, while Devin's brigade moved farther to the right along the
Middle Road beyond St. Johns Church.  As Devin maneuvered, Lomax
counterattacked down the Valley Pike, driving the Reserve brigade
back to Tom's Brook.  Lowell, in turn, attacked until stopped by
artillery, At last, Devin reached a position from which to
operate against the flanks of both Lomax and Rosser.  He advanced
the 9NY and other elements against Lomax's left and rear
(probably down current rte. 657), making Lomax's position
untenable.  The Confederates began to retreat up the pike toward
Woodstock.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.  Rear Guard Action at Pugh's Run:</B> Rosser
retreated, losing at least two of his guns at Spiker's Hill. 
Munford's brigade attempted a stand behind Pugh's Run on the Back
Road, but this position was quickly breached.  The CS cavalry
continued to retreat to Columbia Furnace, losing the rest of its
artillery and all of its wagons.  Perhaps 150 CS prisoners were
captured during this phase of the retreat.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Six.  Rear Guard Action at Woodstock:</B> Lomax
retreated up the Valley Pike to Woodstock, where he was joined by
a confused portion of Rosser's command.  The forces attempted to
stand behind Pugh's Run but were soon scattered.  Union troopers
pressed forward, driving the CS cavalry to Mt. Jackson.  Lomax
lost five pieces of artillery and his rolling stock during this
rout--two pieces at Woodstock, two at Edinburg, and the fifth
beyond Stony Creek.  The Union cavalry retired to the vicinity of
Woodstock where it bivouacked for the night.

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The focal points of action were Spiker's Hill where the Back
Road crosses Tom's Brook, and the area southwest of the village
of Tom's Brook along US 11 (Valley Pike) between Tom's Brook and
Jordon Run.  The network of roads between US 11 and Spiker's Hill
played a shaping role in the unfolding Union strategy.
<p><p>
Several vantage points and viewsheds are essential for
interpreting the battle: a) view from Round Hill where there was
a US signal station at the time of the battle; b) Sand Ridge
Church Hill, which allows interpretation from Custer's line and
provides a panorama from Round Hill to Little North Mountain; and
c) from Spiker's Hill where Rosser concentrated his command.  If
viewsheds from these three points could be preserved, the
battlefield could be interpreted and would retain a high degree
of historic integrity and rural setting.  Many historic
structures remain in the vicinity, including the Peter Muhlenburg
Farm (County Alms House) at Maurertown and the Thornton house
which served as a stage stop on the Back Road.  A 21-acre parcel
of Lomax's position across the Valley Turnpike (US 11) has been
preserved as a county recreation park.  The park offers no
interpretation of the battle.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Almost all of the battlefield of Tom's Brook is privately
owned.  There are several immediate threats to the integrity of
the above-mentioned viewsheds.  A parcel on the summit of
Spiker's Hill may be subdivided; survey work has been conducted
but as of this writing construction has not begun.  Construction
of more houses on Spiker's Hill would degrade the viewshed's
current high integrity.  The area where the Reserve brigade
attempted to turn Lomax's left flank was recently threatened by
possible subdivision of the Heischmann property (about 150
acres).  This property was auctioned in parcels but a local
resident acquired the entire property and plans to continue
farming. 
<p><p>
     The viewshed from Round Hill may be threatened by
development adjacent to the I-81 interchange where there is
currently a truck stop complex with peripheral commercial
enterprises.  The interchange has spurred residential development
along rte. 642, south of the truck stop.  A portion of land is
currently being developed as a subdivision where the Middle Road
(rte. 642) crosses Tom's Brook.  The I-81 interchange will
certainly continue to stimulate further residential development
in this area.
<p><p>
An L-shaped section of property south of the Truck Stop and
I-81 along rte. 651 (about 250 acres) is owned by a local
developer who has sought to rezone the property for
industrial/commercial/business.  Initial requests for rezoning
were denied because of concerns over water quality.  The impact
of development of this section of land on the viewshed from Round
Hill should be evaluated; the property near the intersection of
rte. 651 and US 11 was part of Merritt's division bivouac area
the night before the battle.
<p><p>
The strip along US 11 south of the village of Tom's Brook
has been developed for a trailer court and other residential
housing; a commercial/residential strip runs the rest of the way
into the town of Tom's Brook.  The right flank of Lomax's line
along rte. 650 is lined with trailers and houses, making
interpretation difficult.  Lomax's bivouac and HQ area in the
vicinity of the Peter Muhlenburg Farm (County Alms House) is
managed by the county.  Efforts to preserve the rural character
of the cross roads between Back Road and the Valley Pike (rtes.
653, 655, 657, and 642), which were used as routes of maneuver by
the US cavalry, would enhance the battlefield setting.
