<h1>PART FOUR: BATTLEFIELD INTEGRITY</h1> 
<h2>THREAT, RISK, AND RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
<p><p>
Part Four describes the integrity of the fifteen battlefields as
determined by both field survey and GIS techniques, discusses the
level of threat to each of the sites, and classifies them by
categories of risk.  Possible preservation and interpretation
scenarios are described for the battlefields, and a time frame
for preservation action is offered.<p>

<b>1. Field Survey of Battlefield Integrity</b>
<p><p>
The fifteen battlefields were examined by the field surveyor and
rated in terms of their perceived similarity to the Civil War
landscape.  Although time has not stopped at any of these sites,
the currently existing features of the rural landscape were used
as a baseline.  A distinction was made between changes to the
landscape wrought by crop cycles; woodland succession or less
dense, single family residential growth; and abrupt changes
caused by the introduction of a radically non-historic land use
practice, such as the construction of new, non-historic roads and
high density housing developments, or the recontouring of the
ground.
<p><p>
In most cases, farming or new woodland cover preserves all
historic ground contours and enables interpretation of the
battlefield, even when a specific viewshed might be obscured. 
Single family dwellings on large lots were usually not deemed
intrusive if the balance of surrounding rural land was
maintained.  The presence of historic structures, ruins, or other
survivals, such as earthworks and stone fences, was weighed
against the presence of modern structures or other alterations
and in many cases boosted the rating of specific battlefield
parcels.  Historic districts listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, such as Winchester and New Market were
considered a reinforcement of integrity, since these areas tend
to maintain the street grid, scale, and mass of the Civil War
era.
<p><p>
With each modern addition to or alteration of the historic
landscape, the condition of a battlefield is eroded and the
ability to understand and interpret a site is degraded.  While a
battlefield's study area can absorb some degree of alteration
(depending on the site), the loss of core area acreage inhibits
the interpretation of essential battlefield events and at some
imprecise point prohibits interpretation altogether.  Although
some level of interpretation can occur on smaller parcels of
land, preservation of the land where the battle took place
enables a fuller understanding of events.
<p><p>
The ratings derived from the field-survey evaluation forms apply
generally to the entire study area of a battlefield.  A ``Good''
rating denotes that the appearance of the site is essentially
unchanged from the historic period with respect to terrain, land
use, road network, and mass and scale of buildings. ``Fair''
describes a site where the primary geographical, topographical,
or structural features are largely intact with some changes.
``Poor'' denotes a site where the primary geographical,
topographical, or structural features have been altered, as by
road construction, or other changes of land use.  ``Lost''
denotes a site that has ``changed beyond recognition,'' meaning
that a resident of the time returning to the site today
presumably would not recognize his surroundings.
<p><p>
A larger study area tended to lower the overall rating of a
battlefield because of the greater likelihood of
intrusions--visual and physical--even though essential core
parcels were substantially intact.  With a smaller study area, on
the other hand, the effects of land use alterations tended to be
amplified and more immediately communicated to the battlefield
core.
<p><p>
Only those battlefields with few large-scale additions or
alterations in both study and core areas received the highest
marks.  These were <a href="svs3-2.html">McDowell</a>, 
<a href="svs3-5.html">Cross Keys</a>, 
<a href="svs3-9.html">Piedmont</a>, and 
<a href="svs3-6.html">Port Republic</a>. Battlefields with some
alterations or intrusions (most often interstate highways), yet
retaining relatively high core integrity were 
<a href="svs3-10.html">Cool Spring</a>, 
<a href="svs3-13.html">Fisher's Hill</a>, 
<a href="svs3-14.html">Tom's Brook</a>, 
<a href="svs3-15.html">Cedar Creek</a>,
and <a href="svs3-1.html">First Kernstown</a>.
<p>
Battlefields deemed to have suffered a significant loss of
integrity due to alterations, intrusions, and fragmentation were
<a href="svs3-11.html">Second Kernstown</a>, 
<a href="svs3-7.html">Second Winchester</a>, 
<a href="svs3-3.html">Front Royal</a>, 
<a href="svs3-8.html">New Market</a>, 
<a href="svs3-12.html">Opequon</a>, and 
<a href="svs3-4.html">First Winchester</a>.  Of these sites,
Front Royal and First Winchester
have suffered most, because of the relatively small sizes of the
study and core areas.  These battlefields have been highly
fragmented and essential core areas and defining features lost to
the point and where interpretation of the battle events is
severely inhibited.  Except for a single valley and forested
hill, the core area of First Winchester has been assimilated into
the City of Winchester, with additional new construction planned.
<p><p>
In spite of integrity loss, important core parcels remain for the
battlefields of First and Second Kernstown, Second Winchester,
and Opequon.  In the case of Opequon, surviving core parcels
total more than 900 contiguous acres.  Even First Winchester,
rated as lost retains several small parcels that would enable
commemoration of the battle.
