<h1>PART SIX:  ALTERNATIVES TO PRESERVATION AND INTERPRETATION</h1>

<h2>1. Background</h2><p>
<p><p>
P.L. 101-628, which mandated the study of Civil War sites and
structures in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, calls for the
National Park Service to ``provide alternatives for the
preservation and interpretation of such sites by Federal, State,
and local governments, or other public or private entities, as may
be appropriate.  Such alternatives may include, but shall not be
limited to, designation as units of the National Park System or as
affiliated areas.  The study shall examine methods and make
recommendations to continue current land use practices, such as
agriculture, where feasible.''
<p><p>
The comparison which the National Park Service conducted, using the
Jedediah Hotchkiss 1862 map of the Valley and modern USGS maps of
the same area, indicates a remarkable level of overall integrity--
the retention of the physical and visual qualities of the natural
and manmade environment in the Valley present at the time of the
Civil War, due not only to the unique topography of the region, but
also to continued patterns of agricultural use.  Because few
systematic efforts have been made to preserve the Valley's
battlefields, preservation of battlefield land to date, much of
which was farmed at the time of the war, has depended largely on
the stewardship of private landowners who have continued to farm
the land.  Many of the property names present on the Hotchkiss map
are the names of family members still retaining ownership of these
farms today, most noticeably in the Upper Valley.
<p><p>
The Shenandoah Valley has a vibrant, contemporary mixture of urban,
agricultural, and forested landscape which represents evolving uses
of land by a growing population.  The landscape reflects this
change in such forms as Interstate 81, which has developed as the
Valley's major transportation corridor, and in the growth of modern
cities such as Harrisonburg and Winchester. This is not a region
that ``time has forgotten,'' but rather one which has retained
elements of the past into a contemporary future.  The study
indicates that change in the battlefield areas is intensified
relative to change in other parts of the Valley, due to the
location of these battlefields along major transportation routes
both in the nineteenth century and the twentieth.  There is greater
change to the landscape where agricultural land has been converted
to other uses, particularly in the Lower Valley, near Front Royal
and Winchester.  Most of the battlefields in this area have
witnessed some residential, industrial, and commercial development. 
But many parcels of battlefield land remaining retain a high degree
of integrity
<p><p>
Despite the overall good integrity of major battlefields in the
Shenandoah Valley, some sites have deteriorated, and preservation
possibilities are constrained.  Earlier, in Part Four, an analysis
of the relative importance was given for each battlefield based on
historic significance, integrity, threats, and risks to
preservation.<p>
