<H2>3.  Overview of Military Strategy in the Shenandoah
Valley</H2>
<p><p>
Throughout the Civil War, Confederate armies used the Shenandoah
Valley as a natural corridor to invade or threaten invasion of
the North.  Because of its southwest-northeast orientation,
Confederate armies marching down the Valley approached Washington
and Baltimore, while Union armies marching up the Valley moved
farther away from Richmond.  The Blue Ridge served as a natural
screen for the movement of troops.  By defending the gaps with
cavalry, Confederate armies could move swiftly north behind the
protective wall of the Blue Ridge into Maryland and Pennsylvania;
<a href="relee.gif">Gen. Robert E. Lee</a> did this in the
Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, as did <a href="early.gif">Jubal
Early</a> in 1864.  The Blue Ridge offered similar protection to
Lee's army during its retreats from Antietam and Gettysburg.
<p><p>
When the need arose, Confederate defenders could hold the gaps in
reverse against a Union army operating in the Valley.  By
withdrawing to the Blue Ridge near Brown's Gap to protect
Charlottesville and eastern Virginia, the Confederates could
threaten the flank and rear of any Union forces intent on
penetrating the Upper Valley.  The western gaps in the Allegheny
chain were defended by Confederates against sporadic Union feints
and incursions from West Virginia.
<p><p>
On the whole, Confederate armies succeeded in preventing deep
Union penetration of the Upper Valley until late in the war, and
Valley geography cooperated with the defense.  Where the
Massanutten Mountain rises abruptly between Front Royal and
Strasburg, the width of the Valley is greatly decreased.  With
strong infantry at Fisher's Hill in the main valley south of
Strasburg and cavalry at Overall (antebellum Milford) in the
Luray Valley, a Confederate general could effectively hold the
Upper Valley against a numerically superior enemy.  Fisher's Hill
astride the Valley Turnpike was an important strategic ``choke
point'' throughout the war.
<p><p>
If Confederate generals chose to withdraw up the Valley Turnpike
from Fisher's Hill, any pursuing Union general was forced to
split his forces at the Massanutten in order to cover an advance
up both the main and the Luray valleys.  Once divided, he could
not again reunite his forces for more than fifty miles because of
the intervening mountain.  Only a single rough road crossed the
Massanutten--running from New Market to Luray through the New
Market Gap.
<p><p>
<a href="jackson.gif">Thomas J. ``Stonewall''
Jackson</a> used Massanutten Mountain to screen his offensive
movements in the 1862 Valley Campaign.  Crossing from New Market
to the Luray Valley in May, he advanced on Front Royal and then
on Winchester, forcing the Union army, then at Strasburg, into
abrupt withdrawal.  Later in the campaign, he prevented two Union
columns advancing against him up the main and Luray valleys from
reuniting and defeated each separately in the climax of his
campaign at the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic.
<p><p>
The Shenandoah Valley was referred to as the ``Granary of
Virginia.'' It was the richest agricultural region in Virginia,
and its abundance supplied the Confederate cause.  Because a
large number of the inhabitants of Frederick, Shenandoah,
Rockingham, and Augusta counties were pacifist Quakers or Dunkers
who refused to fight in the war, the Valley continued to produce
horses, grains, and livestock even after other portions of
Virginia were made barren by the flight of slaves or the
enlistment and conscription of the farmers.  As the war
continued, the City of Richmond and the Army of Northern
Virginia, pinned down in the trenches at Richmond and Petersburg,
came to depend more heavily on produce shipped from the Valley on
the Virginia Central Railroad.  Capturing the supply depot of
Staunton and severing this railroad became a major objective of
the Union armies in 1864.
<p><p>
As the war progressed, Lynchburg, too, became an important
objective of Union campaigns in the Valley.  In 1864, several
expeditions--up the Valley from Winchester, and north from Bulls
Gap, Tennessee--were devised to capture Lynchburg, but the city
remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war.
<p><p>
For the Union, defending the vulnerable B&O Railroad and the line
of the Potomac River were essential considerations for any
operations in the Shenandoah Valley.  Because of implicit threats
against Washington, a small Confederate army in the Valley could
pin down three to five times its number in Union defenders,
threaten vital Union transportation and communication lines, and
carry the war to the North, if opportunity presented itself.
<p><p>
As the war dragged on, the Shenandoah Valley increased in
importance to the Southern cause, and correspondingly it became
more urgent that the Northern armies succeed there after dramatic
failures in 1862, 1863, and May 1864.  Ultimately, the Northern
army was forced to lay waste to the agricultural abundance of the
Valley in order to destroy support for the Southern war effort.
