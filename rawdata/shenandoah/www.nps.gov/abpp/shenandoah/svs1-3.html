<H2>3. Battlefield Selection</H2><p>
<p>
The Shenandoah Valley was a battleground of armies.  There, a
long line of Union generals--Banks, Fre‚mont, Shields, Milroy,
Sigel--met disaster.  There, Thomas J. ``Stonewall'' Jackson
confused and scattered his enemies.  Richard ``Old Bald Head''
Ewell led his corps to a victory at Winchester so complete that
it was ``as if a second Jackson had come.''  Jubal A. Early
directed the tattered remnants of Jackson's and Ewell's old
divisions on a whirlwind campaign, until a Union general of
different measure--``Little Phil''--applied the torch to the
Valley to destroy its agricultural production.  In Struggle for
the Shenandoah (Kent State University Press, 1991), editor Gary
W. Gallagher writes:<p>

<blockquote>
Few geographical regions associated with the Civil War inspire
more dramatic images than the Shenandoah Valley.  Some of the
images are romantic, heavily charged with the gloss of improbable
Southern triumph against long odds.  The figure of Thomas J.
``Stonewall'' Jackson towers above all others of this type,
waging a bold campaign that catapulted the dour Virginian to a
lofty position as the most famous soldier in the Confederacy. 
Just behind Jackson's exploits in any catalog of memorable scenes
from the Valley come the young men of the Virginia Military
Institute, who achieved their own form of immortality when they
fought and died to help win the Battle of New Market in May 1864.
Cast in darker hues are Philip H. Sheridan and the Federal army
that brought the agony of U. S. Grant's strategy of exhaustion to
the Valley during the last autumn of the war.  Sheridan and his
men left a legacy of blackened ruin that served as graphic
counterpoint to the storied lushness of the area.  From beginning
to end, the Valley bore witness to events that across more than a
century and a quarter continue to evoke emotional responses from
students of the war.

Fighting was more or less continuous over four years of Valley
warfare, but the pivotal conflicts of the Valley have been
identified and studied by historians.  After consultation with <a
href="bearss.gif">Edwin C. Bearss</a>, Chief Historian
of the National Park Service, Jeffry Wert, author and consulting
historian for the study, and other historians, fifteen of the
Valley's most important battlefields, associated with campaigns
in 1862, 1863, and 1864, were selected for field assessment <A

Thomas J. ``Stonewall'' Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign is widely
studied by modern military historians and strategists.  The names
of Kernstown, McDowell, Front Royal, First Winchester, Cross
Keys, and Port Republic, are familiar to any student of this
campaign.  In 1863, Confederate victory at Second Winchester
cleared the Valley of Union forces and opened the door for Robert
E. Lee's second invasion of the North, which climaxed at
Gettysburg.  New Market and Piedmont resulted from Union
incursions southward in May and June of 1864 in support of
Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign against Richmond.  The
battle of New Market was a rousing Confederate victory, but at
Piedmont, roles were reversed.  Outflanked and with their general
killed, the Southerners fled from the field, opening the Upper
Valley to ``Black Dave'' Hunter's army for the first time in the
war.  Jubal A. Early's Confederate army defeated Hunter at
Lynchburg and marched north from Lynchburg in late June, invaded
Maryland, and by mid-July threatened Washington.  Early's return
to the Valley resulted in the conflicts of Cool Spring and Second
Kernstown.  With the appointment of Philip H. Sheridan to command
the Union army in the Valley, the conflict grew desperate.  The
battle of Opequon was hotly contested, but the Confederate army
retired from the field.  A few days later, the Confederate army
was routed at Fisher's Hill, and Sheridan began implementing a
``scorched earth'' policy in the Valley that reached all the way
from Staunton to Strasburg.  Tom's Brook was the major cavalry
battle of Sheridan's final campaign.  Cedar Creek was a last gasp
effort by Jubal Early to surprise the Union army and reverse his
fortunes.  He very nearly succeeded.  Together, these fifteen
battlefields represent the range of major conflicts that
characterized warfare in the Valley in the years 1861-1865.<p>
<p>
These events do not encompass all of the sites associated with
the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley.  The historic towns that
line the old Valley Turnpike (modern US 11) themselves may be
justly proud of their role in history.  The names of Newtown
(Stephens City), Middletown, Strasburg, Woodstock, Edinburg, Mt.
Jackson, Lacey Spring, Harrisonburg, Mt. Crawford, and Staunton,
among others, are familiar to students of Civil War literature. 
A large number of historic antebellum structures survive in the
Valley, many closely associated with lesser engagements or
partisan activities.  Many of these structures are specifically
mentioned in battle accounts or memoirs as serving as
headquarters, refitting stations, or hospitals.  The battle
fought within the present limits of the City of Waynesboro on
March 2, 1865, destroyed the remnants of the Confederate army and
ended the struggle in the Valley.  The City of Lexington offers
many Civil War resources, including the Virginia Military
Institute, the Stonewall Jackson House, and the grave of
Stonewall Jackson.<p>
<p>
Although much needed, a full inventory of these historic
resources could not be attempted for the region, given the
limited time and funds available.  Instead, we have focused on
major battlefields because they tend to be large landscapes,
whose historic character is extremely vulnerable to development,
highway construction, and visual intrusion. It is true that much
has been lost to the ravages of time and neglect, but the
resources that remain are rich and varied.  Coordinated action
could preserve many of these locations for the appreciation of
future generations of Americans.<p>
