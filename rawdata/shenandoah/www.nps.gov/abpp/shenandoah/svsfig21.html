for incorporation into the National Park System or Affiliated
Area</H2>

<EMP>Status must meet the Criteria for National Significance,
Suitability, and Feasibility.</EMP>

=================================================================
<h3>I. National Significance (NPS and Affiliated Area)</h3>
<OL>
     <LI>It is an outstanding example of a particular type of
     resource.
     <LI>It possesses exceptional value or quality in
     illustrating or interpreting the natural or cultural themes
     of our Nation's heritage.
     <LI>It offers superlative opportunities for recreation, for
     public use and enjoyment, or for scientific study.
     <LI>It retains a high degree of integrity as a true,
     accurate, and relatively unspoiled example of the resource.
</OL>
     <h3>IIa. Suitability and Feasibility (Affiliated Areas
Only)</h3>
<OL> <LI>It must need some special recognition or technical
     assistance beyond what is available through existing
     NPS programs in order to ensure its preservation and
     interpretation to the public, and
     <LI>It must be demonstrated that a cooperative
     arrangement with the National Park Service and
     contributions from other sources will be adequate to
     assure long-term protection of the resources, and
     <LI>It must be demonstrated that a continued standard
     of maintenance, operations, public service, and
     financial accountability consistent with requirements
     applicable to National Park System units will occur.
</OL>
<h3>IIb. Suitability and Feasibility (NPS units only)</h3>
<OL>
     <LI>It represents a natural or cultural theme, or type of
     recreational resource that is not already adequately
     represented in the National Park System, or is not
     comparably represented and protected for public enjoyment by
     another land-managing entity.

     <LI>It must be of sufficient size and appropriate
     configuration to ensure long-term protection of the
     resources and to accommodate public use. 

     <LI>It must have potential for efficient administration at a
     reasonable cost.  Important feasibility factors include land
     ownership, acquisition costs, access, threats to the
     resource, and staff or development requirements. 
</OL>
