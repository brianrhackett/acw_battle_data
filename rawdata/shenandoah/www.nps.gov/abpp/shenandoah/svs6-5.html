<B>Cedar Creek Maps:</B> Atlas 82:9; 85:33, 38, 99:2; Gillespie,
LC #537: ``Battlefields of Fisher's Hill and Cedar Creek

of vicinity of Strasburg, Archives G166-1, very detailed,
surveyed map of US entrenchments at Cedar Creek, surveyed map
using contour intervals, showing vegetation cover for area from

1862, rough sketch of battle ground drawn from memory, not in
scale, shows general areas of woodland and elevation, shows
movement of troops and positions of batteries. Hotchkiss, LC #95:
quick sketch of battlefield in pencil, showing roads, drainage,
residences, woodlots, and elevation in some areas by hachures,
but not in scale. William Allan, plate VIII, pg. 147.<p><p>

<B>Fisher's Hill Maps:</B> Atlas 82:11, 85:20, 99:2; Gillespie,
LC #537: ``Battlefields of Fisher's Hill and Cedar Creek
Virginia'' Prepared by Bvt. LT. Col. G. L. Gillespie, major of

<B>Front Royal Maps:</B> Atlas 5:5, "Sketch of Lt. Col. Parham of
29PA." not in scale.<p><p>

<B>First Kernstown Maps:</B> Hotchkiss Collection (LC): Two
excellent maps of First Kernstown. LC #H90: ``Battle of
Kernstown,'' 2 in.=1 mi. (1:31,680), colored pencils and ink,
fine detail, fencerows (stone or wood), veg in green, orchards,
houses and residents, troop movements in red and blue, battery
posits., hachures. Not in the Atlas. LC #91: ``Battle of
Kernstown,'' 2 in1 mi. (1:31,680), a more stylized version of the
above map in black ink, Confed. troops shown in red, Union
positions not shown, wood and stone fences, vegetation, roads and
trails, hachures, road lines appear more carefully surveyed on
this map than on #90. These two maps provide all necessary topo
info. Most authoritative source for Confed. movements. Union
troop movements will need to be expanded from other sources, such
as the map in William Allan, plate III following pg. 54<p>

<B>Second Kernstown Maps:</B> Atlas 84:21; See Hotchkiss LC #H90,
91 under First Kernstown. Kennedy, Battlefield Guide pg.

of the battle of McDowell,'' scale 1:31,680, 24x30cm., unfinished
sketch, shows elevation by hachures, vegetation suggested in
green pencil, Union and Confederate troop positions shown in blue
and red, appears to have been executed quickly, not detailed
enough to be useful for topography. Hotchkiss, LC #94: an even
rougher sketch in ink on brown paper, not in scale. William
Allan, plate IV pg. 55.<p><p>

<B>New Market Maps:</B> Colonna, LC #585: ``New Market Virginia
Battlefield May 15, 1864,'' surveyed 1910-12, B. A. Colonna,

intervals and hachures, woods, orchards, houses, and other
features verified by veterans and authorities, shows battle
lines, 50 significant events keyed to numbers. Colonna was a
participant in the battle.<p><p>

<B>Opequon (Third Winchester) Maps:</B> Atlas 99:1, 85:12-18; By
far the best and most detailed maps of this battle are the
surveys of 1873 by Gillespie, Dept. of Engineers, done in
consultation with veterans of North and South. One version of
this map is Plate 99:1 in the Atlas of the Official Records;
scale 1 in.=2,200 ft. The original Gillespie map is in the Civil
War Collection LC #670, scale 1 in.=800 ft or 1:9600; 96x114 cm.

vegetation and fields marked, elevation by contour intervals,

shown, troop movements shown for several positions during the
day. Map is in four adjoined sections, each 19x23.5 ins.<p><p>

completed from wartime sketches by Hotchkiss in 1886. Scale is
not ideal, but details are sufficient to produce good modern map.

<B>Tom's Brook Maps:</B> Atlas 85:34 (shows successive positions
taken by cavalry against Custer; Hotchkiss, LC #H187: ``Map of
Vicinity of Fisher's Hill,'' 1864, colored ms., scale 1:40,000,
44x37cm, on tracing cloth, roads in red, wooded areas green,
