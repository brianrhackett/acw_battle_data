<H2>2.  Preservation Priorities</H2>
<p><p>
The <A HREF="svsfig19.html">listing of risks to preservation
(Figure 19)</A> leaves unanswered the public policy question of
whether it is better to focus preservation and protection efforts
on sites nearly lost, or on sites where pristine landscape
remains well-preserved and the Civil War setting is evoked
easily.  There are important arguments to be made for either
approach. 
<p>
The low risk, good condition sites often lend themselves to a
high degree of protection and preservation with minimum costs and
least disruption of local people while resulting in retention of
the highest quality historic sites.  
<p>
On the other hand, the high risk, poor condition sites
generally would require higher costs and often more difficult
resolution of competing interests.  However, these sites
represent historic events of great importance, and if action is
not taken soon, there will not even be site fragments remaining
to commemorate the former existence of these battle locations,
notwithstanding the fact that preservation opportunities may
already be gone.
<p>
Similarly, there are good reasons to choose an intermediate
category of risk as the primary focus -- for example, sites that
are in good-to-fair condition but under moderate levels of
threat, or sites that are in poor-to-fair condition experiencing
yet greater levels of threat.  The rationale here is that sites
in the
intermediate risk categories represent problems that are
manageable, while good condition, low threat sites can wait
longer,
and lost or poor condition sites under extreme threats may not be
worth the cost, 
<p>
The answer to which approach is preferable is not one the
National Park Service can provide as a result of analysis.  This
is a policy choice that will depend to a large degree on which
combination of the preservation alternatives outlined below is
chosen, and on what sort of public consensus exists for
protecting Shenandoah Valley Civil War battlefields.
