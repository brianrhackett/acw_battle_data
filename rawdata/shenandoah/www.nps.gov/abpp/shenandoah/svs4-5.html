<H2>5. Risk Classification</H2>
<p><p>
To further develop a priority list of battlefields, the level of
threat was combined with the current integrity to classify each
battlefield according to its ``at risk'' standing.  Integrity
describes the current condition of a battlefield.  The level of
threat suggests what to anticipate for the site in the
foreseeable future.  Combining present and potential conditions,
produces an assessment of risk for each of the battlefields.  The
field survey ratings were used to classify sites.  Although core
areas are used for this classification, risks for the larger
study areas are generally consistent with and follow those of the
core areas.  
<p><p>
<a href="svsfig18.html">Figure 18</a> summarizes the risk
classification for the fifteen battlefields as described below
(threats 1-5, integrity A-D):
<p><p><ul>
<li><b>Highest Risk (A1, B1):</b>  lost or poor integrity with
very
high threat; 
<li><b>High Moderate (2B, 2C, 3B):</b>  poor to fair integrity
with
high or moderate threat; 
<li><b>Low Moderate (3C, 3D):</b>  fair to good integrity with
moderate threat; 
<li><b>Lowest Risk (4D, 5D):</b>  good integrity with low or very
low levels of threat.
</ul><p><p>
Within each of the subcategories in the table, battlefields were
ranked by relative size in core acreage in ascending order
because it is assumed that, of two battlefields under similar
threat, the smaller would be more quickly damaged by further loss
of integrity.  This order, moving down each column and from left
to right, was then used to produce the risk priority ranking.
<p><p>
Sites with the highest risk are experiencing very high threats
and already are in lost or poor condition as coherent battlefield
landscapes.  Any protection or interpretation at these sites will
be limited to relatively small fragments and focused largely on
commemoration.  Limited potential remains to interpret the battle
or to convey a realistic sense of the battle setting and the
terrain and other military conditions experienced by the troop
formations and their commanders.  Such sites include <a
href="svs3-3.html">Front Royal (1862)</a>, <a href="svs3-7.html">1st Winchester (1862)</a>,
 and <a href="svs3-12.html">Opequon (1864)</a>.
<p><p>
Sites with the lowest risk are in good condition and experiencing
low to very low levels of threats ranging from <a href="svs3-2.html">McDowell (1862)</a>
 with no currently identified threats
to very gradual expansion of residential construction at <ahref="svs3-5.html">Cross Keys (1862)</a>,
<a href="svs3-6.html">Port Republic (1862)</a>, and <a href="svs3-9.html">Piedmont (1864)</a>.
  Protection of these sites can focus
on ways to build community consensus in order to implement a long
range landscape or agricultural preservation plan.  Three of
these sites represent Jackson's 1862 Campaign, including its
culmination at Cross Keys and Port Republic.
<p><p>
The majority of battlefield sites are arrayed in intermediate or
moderate risk situations which have been divided into ``high
moderate'' and ``low moderate'' categories depending on the
particular gravity of the integrity/threats combination.  High
moderate sites include <a href="svs3-1.html">First Kernstown
(1862)</a> and <a href="svs3-11.html">Second Kernstown
(1864)</a>, <a href="svs3-7.html">Second Winchester (1863)</a>,
<a href="svs3-8.html">New Market(1864)</a>, and <a href="svs3-14.html">Tom's Brook (1864)</a>.  
Low moderate sites include <a
href="svs3-13.html">Fisher's Hill (1864)</a>, <a href="svs3-15.html">Cedar Creek (1864)</a>, 
and <a href="svs3-10.html">Cool
Spring (1864)</a>.  Many types and combinations of preservation
and interpretive efforts may be appropriate to these sites,
focusing on high moderate sites for the near term and low
moderate sites for longer range plans.
