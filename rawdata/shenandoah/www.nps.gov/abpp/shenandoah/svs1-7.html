<H2>7. Surveying Battlefield Resources</H2>
<p>
<p>
Before visiting the battlefields, the study's researchers
examined documentary sources to establish a regional context to
enable better understanding of how geography and topography
influenced the strategies of conflict in the Valley.  This
research involved an examination of the settlement pattern and
transportation network of the mid-nineteenth century.  The Valley
was a relatively densely settled and highly productive
agricultural region.  Understanding the historic framework,
enabled the field surveyors to better determine the current
condition of the battlefields.
<p>
<p>
Second, a historic or ``campaign'' context was established for
each event to determine its relative importance.  Primary and
secondary source materials were consulted--particularly battle
accounts compiled in The War of the Rebellion: Official Records
of the Union and Confederate Armies and historic maps held by the
National Archives and the Library of Congress--to identify the
location and extent of the battle ``on the ground.'' The regional
and campaign context are presented in Part Two of this report.  A
list of consulted sources may be found in <a href="svs6-5.html">Appendix A</a>.  The strategy and historic campaign
contexts are presented in <a href="svs2-1.html">Part Two</a>.
<p>
<p>
For most of the fifteen battlefields studied, useful primary and
secondary works exist to guide the researcher.  Jackson's 1862
Campaign, for example, was extensively dissected immediately
after the war by eminent military historians of the time, such as
G.F.R.  Henderson, or by actual participants, such as William
Allan and Jedediah Hotchkiss.  Since then, voluminous studies
have been offered to interpret Jackson's triumph.  The 1864
battles, on the other hand, although typically larger and more
sanguinary than Jackson's affairs, are generally less written
about.  Two battlefields in particular--Piedmont and Tom's
Brook--were found to have received insufficient treatment by
secondary sources, and few reliable historic maps or sketches
were discovered.  For these battlefields, more intensive research
was conducted into the primary accounts, such as diaries,
memoirs, regimental histories, and local histories.  Local guides
provided the final word on several areas in question.
<p>
<p>
Of inestimable value were the maps and sketches produced by
Jedediah Hotchkiss, a resident of Staunton who served as the
topographic engineer for Confederate generals Thomas J. Jackson,
Richard S. Ewell, and Jubal A. Early.  Hotchkiss was a
participant-observer of almost every major Valley battlefield and
left behind an unparalleled cartographic record.  Fully half of
the Confederate maps contained in the Official Military Atlas of
the Civil War were supplied by Hotchkiss.  In Spring 1862,
Stonewall Jackson asked him to ``make me a map of the Valley.''
The resulting map, measuring three by eight feet, served as a
blueprint for Jackson's 1862 campaign and subsequent Confederate
operations in the Valley.  The Union armies lacked a map of its
equal until well into 1864.  In addition to basic topography and
watershed information, the Valley map traces more than 4,500 road
segments, provides 230 historic place names, locates 260 mills,
forges, schools, churches, tollhouses and other commercial and
industrial structures, and identifies more than 1,000 farms by
name of resident.  Because of its pivotal importance, the Valley
Map of Jedediah Hotchkiss was reduced to computerized format in
its entirety.  This computerized map will be housed at an
appropriate facility in the Valley and made available to
historical and genealogical researchers.
<p>
<p>
To supplement text and map records, every attempt was made to
locate a knowledgeable local guide to accompany the research
historian in the field.  This was typically someone who had
studied the battle, who lived in or was familiar with the area,
and who had walked the battlefield many times.  In the field, the
researcher sought access to vantage points from which the ground
could be examined and the action interpreted.  Where permission
was granted from landowners (most sites), the battlefield ground
was walked.  An evaluation form was completed for each site,
breaking down the narrative action of each battle into phases
that could be more closely associated with specific blocks of
land.  An assessment was then made about the condition of each
phase area relative to its described or probable appearance at
the time of the Civil War.  Historic structures were located on
USGS maps, along with any survivals, such as field
fortifications, old road beds, mill sites, building foundations,
burial sites, or monuments.  When a site visit was completed, the
battlefield was then summarized across phases and rated according
to its overall condition and perceived threats to its integrity. 
These summary forms with accompanying maps and photographs were
reviewed for accuracy by <a href="bearss.gif">Edwin
Bearss</a> and Jeffry Wert, the study's two consulting
historians.  These complete battlefield descriptions are included
in <a href="svs3-1.html">Part Three</a>.
<p>
<p>
Finally, the field maps were turned over to the NPS Interagency
Resources Division's Cultural Resources GIS Facility for further
analysis.  The battlefield areas were entered into the computer
along with other data that enabled an examination of land use
within the battlefields.  A separate, computer-based integrity
rating scale was devised to compare the number of undeveloped
acres with the amount of built-up land within the study and core
areas.  This computer evaluation was then used as a check for
visual integrity evaluations made in the fields and discussed in
<a href="svs4-2.html">Part Four</a>.
<p>
<p>
GIS technology was used to produce the maps included in this
report.  The long-term advantage of using GIS is that a data base
has now been created that can be updated to reflect future land
use changes for the Valley's battlefields.  Troop movements and
surviving features can be added, along with National Register
properties in the vicinity and other points of interest.  The
data can be married with the digitized Hotchkiss Valley map to
show the sites of old homes and mills to guide archeologists and
surveyors.  Local planners can use the computer to evaluate
proposals that may affect the battlefields, such as alternative
routes for a new road to determine which will have the least
impact on a core's integrity.
<p>
<p>
Several Valley counties currently have GIS capability, and plans
are being developed to house the database developed in this study
at a suitable Valley location, where it is accessible to local
and regional planning agencies.  For example, the GIS center at
James Madison University in Harrisonburg has expressed an
interest in serving as the repository for the data base.  Using
GIS to study the battlefields within the context of the
Shenandoah Valley as a whole, offers tremendous potential as one
tool for guiding future growth and development at the regional
and county levels.
