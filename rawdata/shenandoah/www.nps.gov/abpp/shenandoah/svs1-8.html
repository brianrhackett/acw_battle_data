<H2>8. Threats to Battlefield Resources</H2>
<p>
<p>
In many parts of the Valley, the 19th century lies close to the
surface with merely a veneer of changes.  The land is farmed, as
it was a hundred years ago.  Old houses, mills, and churches
survive, or their foundations may be located.  The new road
network is congruent with the old.  Paved county roads follow the
winding courses of old farm roads.  Small villages have grown
into larger towns, yet preserve their core as a historic
district.  Most importantly, the scenic beauty of the Blue Ridge,
North Mountain, and the Shenandoah River continues to enhance the
quality of life of Valley residents and to attract hundreds of
thousands of visitors per year.  When one knows where to look,
the Civil War history of the Shenandoah Valley is everywhere. 
This study shows that the integrity of the Valley's historic
resources is generally high, but several significant battlefields
have suffered severe degradation, and most are threatened in the
near future.  The causes of degradation are rooted in population
growth and economic expansion.  These trends were used to
establish risk categories for the battlefields as described in <a
href="svs4-1.html">Part Four</a>.
<p>
<p>
<i>Population Trends</i>
The Shenandoah Valley of Virginia has changed since the Civil
War, but until recent decades, the rate of change has been
relatively slow.  Until well into the 1950s, agriculture remained
the primary economic activity in the Valley, and although farming
technology improved, residents continued to use the land much as
their predecessors did--to grow crops and raise livestock.  At
the time of the Civil War, the Valley was already fairly densely
inhabited, much of the land that could be farmed was being
farmed, and the transportation network was firmly in place.  The
Valley's towns ranged in size from a few hundred inhabitants to a
few thousand, with Winchester and Staunton being the largest
towns in the region.
<p>
<p>
When examining the pattern of change in the Shenandoah Valley
region as a whole, it is important to note three distinct
battlefield clusters, comprising eleven of the fifteen
battlefields studied: five in the vicinity of Winchester (three
Winchesters, two Kernstowns); four near Strasburg at the head of
Massanutten Mountain (Cedar Creek, Fisher's Hill, Tom's Brook,
and Front Royal); and three south of Harrisonburg at the base of
the Massanutten (Cross Keys, Port Republic, and Piedmont).  In
addition, ten of the fifteen battles were fought on or within a
few miles of the Valley Turnpike, modern US rte 11 (Winchesters,
Kernstowns, Cedar Creek, Fisher's Hill, Tom's Brook, New Market,
Piedmont), underscoring the importance of this thoroughfare for
the movement of troops.  The same transportation routes and
limiting geographic features that contributed to the meeting of
Civil War armies in these strategic areas continue to influence
population growth and density, and land use decisions in the
twentieth century.
<p>
<p>
The Shenandoah Valley's population increased threefold from
107,660 in 1860 to 347,750 in 1990 (see <a
href="svsfig3.html">Figure 3</a>).  Population growth in
the Valley has not been uniform, but centered in and around the
major cities.  The population of Highland County, for example,
has declined since the Civil War.  In general, the population of
the Lower (northern) Valley has increased more rapidly than that
of the Upper (southern) Valley, growth that was partly linked to
the explosive development of the Washington Metropolitan area in
the 1980s.  Winchester continued as the dominant city of the
Lower Valley.  The population density of surrounding Frederick
County increased from 69 persons per square mile in 1970 to 110
in 1990 (See <a href="svsfig4.html">Figure 4</a>),
spurring much new residential and commercial construction.  The
Front Royal area witnessed similar growth.
<p>
<p>
In the 1970s Harrisonburg emerged as the economic center of the
Upper Valley.  After decades of low growth, Harrisonburg's
population nearly doubled between 1960 and 1990, making it the
largest city of the region with a population of nearly 31,000. 
So far, this growth has had minimal impact on the nearby
battlefields of Cross Keys, Port Republic, and Piedmont.
<p>
<p>
Current projections suggest that the population of Virginia will
grow to 7,800,000 by the year 2020, an increase of more than
1,620,000 or 26 percent in the next 30 years.  The population of
the Valley will grow at a slower rate.  Current projections
suggest that the population will grow from 347,750 to 410,900 in
2020, an increase of 18 percent.  Much of this growth will
continue to be associated with the cities of Winchester, Front
Royal, and Harrisonburg.  Population densities for Frederick and
Warren counties, in particular, will increase from 110 and 122 to
136 and 143 persons per square mile, respectively.  Growth
elsewhere in the Valley will be more uneven but undoubtedly will
be concentrated along the interstate highways, as it is today.
<p>
<p>
While portions of the Valley's battlefields have been steadily
eroded over the years by residential, industrial, and commercial
activities, the most destructive event in the history of these
battlefields was the construction of the interstate highway
system in the 1960s.  I-81, which runs the length of the Valley
parallel to the old Valley Turnpike (US 11), intersects the study
areas of First and Second Winchester, Opequon, Second Kernstown,
Cedar Creek, Fisher's Hill, Tom's Brook, and New Market, and
borders on the study area of First Kernstown.  I-66 intersects
the study areas of Front Royal and Cedar Creek.  Ten of the
fifteen battlefields selected for this study were degraded by
interstate highway construction, several severely, e.g., the
three Winchester battlefields and New Market.  Only those
battlefields that are not crossed by interstate highways received
the highest condition ratings both on the field survey evaluation
forms and in the GIS analysis.  Residential and commercial
development adjacent to interstate interchanges has multiplied
the loss of integrity caused by highway construction.  In the
absence of a concerted effort to set aside battlefield lands
along these highways, future growth and development will continue
to damage these resources.  Projects to widen the interstates or
to add interchanges would have considerable impact on battlefield
resources.
<p>
<p>
<i>Loss of Agricultural Land</i>
Archivist Dallas Irvine observed that ``the Civil War was a rural
social war.'' It is true that warfare in the Shenandoah Valley
was largely a rural affair, acted out upon the mid-19th century
agrarian landscape.  In Valley history, the full range of
agricultural possibilities were represented, from large-scale
plantation farming, which was prevalent in the Lower Valley, to
small-scale homestead farming more common to the central region. 
The importance of agriculture to the history and economy of the
Shenandoah Valley, and the fertility of its soils, deserve
special consideration when determining the direction of long-term
growth and development.
<p>
<p>
From the time of the Civil War to the present, preservation of
the region's historic battlefields has depended largely upon the
survival of the rural landscape and the continued strength of
agriculture.  According to the 1987 Federal Agricultural Census,
the Shenandoah Valley (9.9 percent of Virginia's land area and
less than 6 percent of its population) accounted for 17 percent
of the State's agricultural land and 31 percent of the market
value of agricultural products sold.  Agriculture remains the
principal economic activity for several counties, in particular,
Shenandoah, Rockingham, and Augusta.  Although modern farming
techniques have thoroughly supplanted the old, the landscape in
many areas retains the distinctive open pattern of croplands,
pastures, and woodlots, that would not have been unfamiliar to a
Civil War soldier.  So long as this agricultural landscape
survives, the battlefields can be considered ``preserved,'' if
not protected.
<p>
<p>
But there are clear indications that the rural landscape of the
Valley is in decline, and in some places it has already
disappeared.  Between 1964 and 1987, the total acreage in farms
in the region decreased from 1,302,946 to 1,060,056 acres, a
decline of nearly 243,000 acres.  This is comparable to removing
all of the current agricultural land of Rockingham County from
production.  The amount of agricultural land dropped in all
counties (see <a href="svsfig5.html">Figure 5</a>), but
these declines were most destructive (in terms of preserving open
land) when coupled with higher rates of urban growth and
increased population densities, e.g., Warren County (41% loss)
and Frederick County (27% loss).  In these counties, most of the
lost agricultural lands were replaced by residential, commercial,
or industrial developments.
<p>
<p>
Battlefield preservation is strongly linked to farmland
preservation.  While the effects of a loss of farmland on
specific battlefields must be assessed site-by-site, it seems
clear that the public cannot expect agricultural land uses to
continue to preserve open land that conveniently coincides with
the Valley's Civil War battlefields.
<p>
<p>
In many cases, agricultural use of battlefield land is synonymous
with preserving the battlefields, since much of the land was
farmed during the Civil War.  Exceptions may be found in large
scale agribusiness enterprises that erect massive sheds or
factories.  Still, if care were taken in situating new
construction of this type within a battlefield landscape, the
problem of overwhelming the viewshed could be minimized or
avoided.  Buildings could be placed below a ridge line or
screened by trees.  Establishing an agricultural preservation
district also appears to be a viable approach to battlefield
preservation.  The Shenandoah Valley contains some of the richest
farmland in the United States, land that should not be changed to
commercial and residential uses without fully considering the
farmer's role in the Valley's past and the nation's future.
<p>
<p>
The loss of battlefield resources is directly linked to
population and land use trends.  In many cases, county planners
have lacked the documentation that might enable the preservation
of significant parcels through zoning decisions that weigh
historic and cultural resources with the need for new
residential, commercial, and industrial construction.  The 1990
Frederick County Comprehensive Plan was recently revised to
include a new section that recognizes the importance of the
county's Civil War sites.  The revision notes that battlefields
represent an important category of historic resources and that
the dedication of open space to create battlefield parks would
enhance public appreciation of these resources and promote
educational and tourism goals.  The plan adopted methods that
allow property owners the option to participate in zoning or
other regulatory decisions that would affect their historic
properties.
