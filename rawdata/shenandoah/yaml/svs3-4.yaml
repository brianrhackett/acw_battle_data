Significance: >-

  First Winchester was a major victory in
  General Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign.  On the tactical level,
  the battle displays considerable finesse, particularly on the
  part of Ewell's division on the Front Royal Pike.  Brig. Gen.
  Taylor's attack on Bower's Hill is considered a model brigade
  maneuver by military historians.  The ultimate significance of
  Jackson's victory at Winchester was its strategic impact.  Union
  plans for a convergence on Richmond were disrupted by Jackson's
  audacity, and thousands of Union reinforcements were diverted to
  the Valley and the defense of Washington.
  
  
Description of the Battle: >-
  
  Prelude: May 24, 1862, was a disastrous day for Maj. Gen.
  Nathaniel Banks.  Learning that the Confederates had taken Front
  Royal and were closing on Winchester, Banks ordered a hasty
  retreat down the Valley Pike from Strasburg.  His columns were
  attacked at Middletown and again at Newtown (Stephens City) by
  the converging forces of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson.  The
  Confederates took many US prisoners and captured so many wagons
  and stores that they later nicknamed the Union general
  ``Commissary Banks.'' Jackson pressed the pursuit for most of the
  night and allowed his exhausted soldiers but a few hours sleep
  before dawn.
  
  Phase One.  US Deployment at Winchester: Banks now
  deployed at Winchester to slow the CS pursuit.  He had two
  brigades of infantry under Donelly and Gordon, a mixed brigade of
  cavalry under Hatch, and 16 guns.  Gordon's brigade was placed on
  the US right on Bower's Hill with its left flank at the Valley
  Pike, supported by a battery of artillery.  The center of the
  line (Camp Hill) was held by the cavalry supported by two guns. 
  Donelly's brigade was placed in a crescent on the left to cover
  the Front Royal and Millwood roads with the rest of the
  artillery.  At earliest light the CS skirmish line advanced in
  force driving the US pickets back to their main line of battle.
  
  Phase Two.  CS Advance on Front Royal Pike: During the
  night, the advance of Maj. Gen. Richard Ewell's division (four
  brigades) reached Buffalo Lick.  At dawn, he deployed his
  brigades astride the Front Royal Pike and advanced against the
  Union left flank.  His leading regiments (in particular the 21st
  North Carolina) came under heavy fire from US forces deployed
  behind stone fences and were repulsed.  CS forces regrouped and
  brought up artillery.  After about an hour, they again advanced,
  this time sending regiments to either side of the high ground to
  enfilade the Union position.  Donelly (US) withdrew his brigade
  to a position closer to town with his right flank anchored on
  Camp Hill.  Trimble's brigade (CS) then attempted a flanking
  movement to the right beyond the Millwood Road.  This movement
  threatened the US left and rear.  This movement, in conjunction
  with Confederate maneuvers on the left beyond the Valley Pike,
  caused the Union line to collapse in this sector.
  
  Phase Three.  CS Advance on Valley Pike: In conjunction
  with Ewell's advance on the Front Royal Pike, Jackson advanced
  the Stonewall Brigade on the Valley Pike at early dawn in a heavy
  fog.  At Jackson's command, the brigade swept over a hill to the
  left of the pike, driving off the US skirmishers who held it. 
  Jackson quickly placed a section of artillery on the hill to
  engage US artillery on Bower's Hill at a range of less than half
  a mile.  Union sharpshooters along Abrams Creek began picking off
  the cannoneers.  In response, Banks moved his artillery farther
  to the right to enfilade the CS artillery and heavily reinforced
  his right flank with infantry.  Jackson brought up the rest of
  his artillery and a duel ensued with the Union guns on Bower's
  Hill.  It now appeared that the Union forces were preparing to
  turn the Confederate left.
  
  To counter this threat, Jackson deployed Taylor's Louisiana
  brigade, reinforced by two regiments of Taliaferro's, to the left
  along Abrams Creek.  Taylor marched under fire to a position
  overlapping the Union right and then attacked Bower's Hill.  The
  Confederate assault swept irresistibly forward over the crest in
  the face of determined resistance.  The Union right flank
  collapsed, even as the left flank was being pressured by Ewell. 
  Union soldiers began streaming back into town.
  
  Phase Four.  US Retreat: With the collapse of both flanks,
  Union forces retreated through the streets of Winchester and
  north on the Valley Pike.  Confederate pursuit was lethargic, as
  the troops were exhausted from the non-stop marching of the
  previous week.  Nevertheless, many Union prisoners fell into
  Confederate hands.  Ashby's cavalry was disorganized from the
  actions of 24 May and did not pursue until Banks had already
  reached the Potomac River.
  
Current Condition of the Battlefield: >-
  
  The battlefield of First Winchester has been lost as a coherent
  landscape to the growth of the city of Winchester.  Most of the
  core area has been developed for residences on Bower's Hill,
  along US 11, and around the intersection of I-81 and rte. 50. US
  Artillery positions have been built upon and vantage points lost.
  
  According to a county planning official 1,600 new residences have
  been approved for construction at the base of Bower's Hill along
  Abrams Creek.  Access to Battery Hill (Hill 819) north of Cedar
  Creek Grade, west of US 11 and south of railroad tracks, would
  offer an interesting vantage point, although access is
  restricted.  This site overlooks the field over which Taylor's
  Louisiana brigade marched to assault Bower's Hill, just south of
  the water tower.  This same ground was fought over during the
  first day's fighting at Second Winchester when this hill served
  as a CS artillery position.
  
  Willow Lawn, circa 1765, is set back from the road behind an
  industrial building, west of US 11 and north of the railroad. 
  Parkins Mill on US 11 at Abrams Creek (burned in 1864 and rebuilt
  after the war).  All historic structures are surrounded by modern
  buildings.  The Winchester Historic District protects many
  buildings of Civil War vintage and offers a focal point for
  visitors.  Beck and Grunder's ``Three Battles of Winchester''
  provides a driving tour of the battlefield with stops at Camp
  Hill, Milltown, Williamsburg Heights, and Bower's Hill.
  
Perception of Threats to Battlefield: >-
  
  The core area of the First Winchester battlefield has largely
  been lost and, according to a county planning official, 1600
  additional houses are planned for this area in the immediate
  future.  This will eliminate the remaining core area of First
  Winchester and decrease the size of the remaining core area of
  Second Winchester.
