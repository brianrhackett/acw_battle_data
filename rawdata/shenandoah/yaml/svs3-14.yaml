Significance: >-

  Tom's Brook was a battle of strategy and
  maneuver that pitted cavalry against cavalry.  The CS cavalry
  were eager for revenge against the US cavalry, which had been
  burning barns and mills in the Valley for the previous week.  On
  9 October 1864, however, Sheridan ordered his cavalry to ``whip''
  the enemy or get whipped themselves.  In the resulting conflict,
  the US troopers routed the CS cavalry, impairing its morale and
  efficiency for the remainder of the campaign.  The CS flight was
  referred to by Valley residents and victorious Union troopers as
  the ``Woodstock Races.'' The fighting on the Back Road at
  Spiker's Hill pitted two former West Point roommates against one
  another--Tom Rosser and George Armstrong Custer.  Maj. Gen.
  Philip H. Sheridan watched the battle unfold, reputedly from the
  summit of Round Hill.

Description of the Battle: >-

  Phase One.  Disposition of Forces: On 8 October 1864, the
  Confederate Cavalry under overall command of Maj. Gen. Thomas
  Rosser harried the withdrawing US cavalry on the Valley Pike and
  the Back Road, fighting a brisk skirmish along Tom's Brook near
  the Back Road.  The CS cavalry were enraged by the destruction of
  the Valley they had witnessed in the last week and were
  attempting to arrest further destruction.  Rosser had been
  dispatched to the Valley from Petersburg to command the CS
  cavalry and had generally been hailed by the local populace as
  the ``Savior of the Valley.'' At dark, Rosser halted his division
  of three brigades (about 2,500 men) on the Back Road in the
  vicinity of Spiker's Hill and pushed skirmishers beyond Tom's
  Brook to Mt. Olive.  The Middle Road was covered by a force of
  observation of unknown size.  Maj. Gen. Lunsford Lomax's Division
  of two brigades and a battery of horse artillery (about 1,000
  men) bivouacked on both sides of the Valley Pike behind Jordon
  Run just south of the hamlet of Tom's Brook. 

  Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's US cavalry division (about 3,500
  men) under overall command of Brig. Gen. Alfred Torbert encamped
  at the base of Round Hill. Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer's
  division of two brigades (about 2,500), bivouacked ``behind
  Tumbling Run'' northeast of Mt. Olive on the Back Road.  Upset by
  Rosser's aggressive tactics of the previous days, army commander
  Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan ordered Torbert to move at daylight
  of 9 October and ``whip the rebel cavalry or get whipped
  himself.'' 

  Phase Two.  US Advance on Valley Pike: Torbert planned to
  bring an overwhelming force against Rosser's division on the Back
  Road while holding Lomax's division at bay with a reinforced
  brigade on the Valley Pike.  Lomax's main battle line was
  deployed behind Jordon Run on both sides of the Valley Pike,
  supported by six guns.  His front line was dismounted, while he
  maintained a strong mounted reserve on the pike.

  At dawn, Lowell's brigade (Merritt) advanced to Tom's Brook
  on the Pike, deployed, and pushed forward ``one-quarter of a
  mile'' where it found Lomax's main line, dismounted behind Jordon
  Run.  The CS line was supported by six guns placed on either side
  of the Valley Pike and a strong mounted reserve.  While Lowell
  was engaged, Kidd's brigade rode north along Tom's Brook to
  connect and cooperate with Custer.  Devin's brigade followed but
  veered off on the Harrisville Road (or overland) and advanced to
  the vicinity of St. Johns Church, maintaining a connection with
  the force on the Valley Pike and at the same time extending a
  skirmish line to connect with the Kidd's brigade on the right.

  Phase Three.  Custer's Advance/ Fighting on Back Road:
  Rosser dismounted most of his troopers behind Tom's Brook at the
  base of Spiker's Hill behind stone fences and rudimentary
  fieldworks (his brigades from left to right, Munford, Payne, and
  the Laurel brigade).  Rosser's six guns unlimbered along the
  crest of Spiker's Hill slightly behind a second line of
  barricades.  A mounted reserve was maintained on the ridge; the
  right was extended toward the Middle Road with mounted
  skirmishers.

  Advancing beyond Mt. Olive, Custer pushed forward three
  regiments of dismounted skirmishers against the main CS position.
  Three other regiments and Wells' brigade were kept mounted and
  maneuvered for position behind the skirmish line.  A battery of
  artillery unlimbered on the hill in front of present-day St.
  Matthews (or Sand Ridge) Church and engaged the Confederate
  artillery on Spiker's Hill.  When Kidd's brigade made contact
  with Custer's left, Custer extended his right flank along the
  shoulder of Little North Mountain, supporting the movement with a
  battery.  Kidd deployed over the hill, driving Rosser's
  skirmishers before him, and unlimbered another battery to
  enfilade the CS position.  The Confederate line was gradually
  forced back into a horseshoe around the front of Spiker's Hill. 
  A regiment of US cavalry (probably of Devin's brigade), moving on
  the Middle Road from Harrisville arrived on a hill overlooking
  Sand Ridge Road (intersection of Middle Road) and to the right
  and rear of Rosser's main force.  Reacting to this threat, Rosser
  ordered a withdrawal.  His men raced to mount their horses.  At
  this point, Wells brigade attacked Spiker's Hill up the Back
  Road, taking few casualties.  At the crest, Wells encountered
  Munford's brigade and a mounted mel‚e ensued.  Rosser's force
  retreated, partly down Back Road to Pugh's Run, partly on Sand
  Ridge and Middle roads toward Woodstock.  Custer's and Kidd's
  troopers pursued.  General Sheridan is said to have watched the
  action from Round Hill, where there was a US signal station
  during the battle.

  Phase Four.  Fighting on the Valley Pike: In the meantime,
  fighting continued along the Valley Pike.  Lowell's brigade drove
  CS pickets back to Jordon Run and deployed on both sides of the
  pike.  The 1st Michigan (Kidd's brigade) supported Lowell's right
  flank, while Devin's brigade moved farther to the right along the
  Middle Road beyond St. Johns Church.  As Devin maneuvered, Lomax
  counterattacked down the Valley Pike, driving the Reserve brigade
  back to Tom's Brook.  Lowell, in turn, attacked until stopped by
  artillery, At last, Devin reached a position from which to
  operate against the flanks of both Lomax and Rosser.  He advanced
  the 9NY and other elements against Lomax's left and rear
  (probably down current rte. 657), making Lomax's position
  untenable.  The Confederates began to retreat up the pike toward
  Woodstock.

  Phase Five.  Rear Guard Action at Pugh's Run: Rosser
  retreated, losing at least two of his guns at Spiker's Hill. 
  Munford's brigade attempted a stand behind Pugh's Run on the Back
  Road, but this position was quickly breached.  The CS cavalry
  continued to retreat to Columbia Furnace, losing the rest of its
  artillery and all of its wagons.  Perhaps 150 CS prisoners were
  captured during this phase of the retreat.

  Phase Six.  Rear Guard Action at Woodstock: Lomax
  retreated up the Valley Pike to Woodstock, where he was joined by
  a confused portion of Rosser's command.  The forces attempted to
  stand behind Pugh's Run but were soon scattered.  Union troopers
  pressed forward, driving the CS cavalry to Mt. Jackson.  Lomax
  lost five pieces of artillery and his rolling stock during this
  rout--two pieces at Woodstock, two at Edinburg, and the fifth
  beyond Stony Creek.  The Union cavalry retired to the vicinity of
  Woodstock where it bivouacked for the night.

Current Condition of the Battlefield: >-

  The focal points of action were Spiker's Hill where the Back
  Road crosses Tom's Brook, and the area southwest of the village
  of Tom's Brook along US 11 (Valley Pike) between Tom's Brook and
  Jordon Run.  The network of roads between US 11 and Spiker's Hill
  played a shaping role in the unfolding Union strategy.

  Several vantage points and viewsheds are essential for
  interpreting the battle: a) view from Round Hill where there was
  a US signal station at the time of the battle; b) Sand Ridge
  Church Hill, which allows interpretation from Custer's line and
  provides a panorama from Round Hill to Little North Mountain; and
  c) from Spiker's Hill where Rosser concentrated his command.  If
  viewsheds from these three points could be preserved, the
  battlefield could be interpreted and would retain a high degree
  of historic integrity and rural setting.  Many historic
  structures remain in the vicinity, including the Peter Muhlenburg
  Farm (County Alms House) at Maurertown and the Thornton house
  which served as a stage stop on the Back Road.  A 21-acre parcel
  of Lomax's position across the Valley Turnpike (US 11) has been
  preserved as a county recreation park.  The park offers no
  interpretation of the battle.

Perception of Threats to Battlefield: >-
  
  Almost all of the battlefield of Tom's Brook is privately
  owned.  There are several immediate threats to the integrity of
  the above-mentioned viewsheds.  A parcel on the summit of
  Spiker's Hill may be subdivided; survey work has been conducted
  but as of this writing construction has not begun.  Construction
  of more houses on Spiker's Hill would degrade the viewshed's
  current high integrity.  The area where the Reserve brigade
  attempted to turn Lomax's left flank was recently threatened by
  possible subdivision of the Heischmann property (about 150
  acres).  This property was auctioned in parcels but a local
  resident acquired the entire property and plans to continue
  farming. 

  The viewshed from Round Hill may be threatened by
  development adjacent to the I-81 interchange where there is
  currently a truck stop complex with peripheral commercial
  enterprises.  The interchange has spurred residential development
  along rte. 642, south of the truck stop.  A portion of land is
  currently being developed as a subdivision where the Middle Road
  (rte. 642) crosses Tom's Brook.  The I-81 interchange will
  certainly continue to stimulate further residential development
  in this area.

  An L-shaped section of property south of the Truck Stop and
  I-81 along rte. 651 (about 250 acres) is owned by a local
  developer who has sought to rezone the property for
  industrial/commercial/business.  Initial requests for rezoning
  were denied because of concerns over water quality.  The impact
  of development of this section of land on the viewshed from Round
  Hill should be evaluated; the property near the intersection of
  rte. 651 and US 11 was part of Merritt's division bivouac area
  the night before the battle.

  The strip along US 11 south of the village of Tom's Brook
  has been developed for a trailer court and other residential
  housing; a commercial/residential strip runs the rest of the way
  into the town of Tom's Brook.  The right flank of Lomax's line
  along rte. 650 is lined with trailers and houses, making
  interpretation difficult.  Lomax's bivouac and HQ area in the
  vicinity of the Peter Muhlenburg Farm (County Alms House) is
  managed by the county.  Efforts to preserve the rural character
  of the cross roads between Back Road and the Valley Pike (rtes.
  653, 655, 657, and 642), which were used as routes of maneuver by
  the US cavalry, would enhance the battlefield setting.
