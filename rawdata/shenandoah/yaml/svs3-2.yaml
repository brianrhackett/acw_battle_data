Significance: >-

  Some historians consider the battle of
  McDowell the beginning of ``Stonewall'' Jackson's 1862 Valley
  Campaign, while others prefer to include First Kernstown,
  Stonewall's only defeat.  The battle of McDowell is studied today
  by military historians for several reasons.  At the tactical
  level, it can be argued that the US forces achieved a draw. 
  Milroy's ``spoiling attack'' surprised Jackson, seized the
  initiative, and inflicted heavier casualties, but did not drive
  the Confederates from their position.  Historians derive lessons
  about use of terrain, small unit tactics and leadership, and
  overexuberance under fire (12th Georgia).  At the strategic
  level, the battle of McDowell and the resultant withdrawal of the
  US army was an important victory for the South.  The battle
  demonstrated Jackson's strategy of concentrating his forces
  against a numerically inferior foe, while denying his enemies the
  chance to concentrate against him.  Jackson rode the momentum of
  his strategic win at McDowell to victory at Front Royal (23 May)
  and First Winchester (25 May).

Description of the Battle: >-

  Phase One.  CS Advance on Parkersburg Turnpike (7 May):
  Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's columns departed West View and
  Staunton on the morning of 7 May, marching west along the
  Parkersburg turnpike.  Elements of Brig. Gen. Edward Johnson's
  brigade composed the vanguard.  At mid-afternoon, Union pickets
  were encountered at Rodgers' tollgate, where the pike crosses
  Ramsey's Draft.  The Union force, which consisted of portions of
  three regiments (3WV, 32OH, 75OH) under overall command of Brig.
  Gen. Robert Milroy, withdrew hastily, abandoning their baggage at
  the tollgate and retreating to the crest of Shenandoah Mountain.

  At Rodgers', Johnson and Jackson conferred.  The Confederate
  force split into two columns to envelope the US holding position
  on Shenandoah Mountain.  Milroy ordered his force to withdraw and
  concentrate at McDowell, where he hoped to receive
  reinforcements.  Milroy also positioned a section of artillery on
  Shaw's Ridge to impede Johnson's descent from the crest of
  Shenandoah Mountain.  These guns were soon withdrawn with their
  supports to McDowell.  By dusk, Johnson's advance regiments
  reached Shaw's Fork where they encamped.  Because of the narrow
  roads and few camp sites, Jackson's army was stretched 8-10 miles
  back along the pike with its rear guard at Dry Branch Gap. 
  Jackson established his headquarters at Rodgers' tollgate. 
  During the night, Milroy withdrew behind the Bullpasture River to
  McDowell, establishing headquarters in the Hull House.

  Phase Two.  CS Advance to Sitlington's Hill (8 May):
  Starting at dawn of 8 May, the Confederate advance crossed Shaw's
  Ridge, descended to the Cowpasture River at Wilson's House, and
  ascended Bullpasture Mountain.  The advance was unopposed. 
  Reaching the crest of the ridge, Jackson and Jedediah Hotchkiss
  conducted a reconnaissance of the Union position at McDowell from
  a rocky spur right of the road.  Johnson continued with the
  advance to the base of Sitlington's Hill.  Expecting a roadblock
  ahead, he diverged from the road into a steep narrow ravine that
  leads to the top of the hill.  After driving away Union
  skirmishers, Johnson deployed his infantry along the long,
  sinuous crest of the hill.  Jackson asked his staff to find a way
  to place artillery on the hill and to search for a way to flank
  the Union position to the north.

  Phase Three.  Deployment of US Forces: About 1000 hours,
  Brig. Gen. Robert Schenck arrived after a forced march from
  Franklin.  Being senior to Milroy, Schenck assumed overall
  command of the Union force at McDowell with headquarters at the
  Hull House.  He deployed his artillery, consisting of 18 guns on
  Cemetery Hill and near the McDowell Presbyterian Church to defend
  the bridge over the Bullpasture River.  He deployed his infantry
  in line from McDowell south along the river for about 800 yards. 
  He placed one regiment (2WV) on Hull's Hill, west of the river
  and overlooking the pike.  Three companies of cavalry covered the
  left flank on the road to the north of the village.

  Phase Four.  US Attack on Sitlington's Hill: Schenck and
  Milroy sent out skirmishers to contest the base of Sitlington's
  Hill along the river.  As CS forces on the crest of the hill
  increased in numbers, Schenck and Milroy conferred.  Union scouts
  reported that the Confederates were attempting to bring artillery
  to the crest of the hill which would make the US position on the
  bottomland at McDowell untenable.  In absence of an aggressive CS
  advance, Schenck and Milroy attempted a spoiling attack.  Milroy
  advanced his brigade (25OH, 32OH, 75OH, 3WV) and the 82nd Ohio of
  Schenck's brigade, about 2,300 men.  About 1500 hours Milroy
  personally led the attacking force, which crossed the bridge and
  proceeded up the ravines that cut the western slope of the hill.

  In the meantime, Jackson had been content to hold the crest of
  the hill while searching for a route for a flanking movement to
  the north.  He declined to send artillery up the hill because of
  the difficulty of withdrawing the pieces in the face of an
  attack.  Union artillerymen on Cemetery Hill elevated their
  pieces by digging deep trenches in the ground for the gun trails
  and began firing at the Confederates in support of the advancing
  infantry.  Schenck also had a six-pounder hauled by hand to the
  crest of Hull's Hill to fire on the CS right flank above the
  turnpike (some accounts say a section of guns, another says a
  whole battery).  The Union line advanced resolutely up the steep
  slopes and closed on the Confederate position.  The conflict
  became ``fierce and sanguinary.''

  The 3rd West Virginia advanced along the turnpike in an attempt
  to turn the CS right.  Jackson reinforced his right on the hill
  with two regiments and covered the turnpike with the 21st
  Virginia.  The 12th Georgia at the center and slightly in advance
  of the main CS line on the hill crest bore the brunt of the Union
  attack and suffered heavy casualties.  The fighting continued for
  four hours as the Union attackers attempted to pierce the center
  of the CS line and then to envelope its left flank.  Nine CS
  regiments were engaged, opposing five US regiments in the fight
  for Sitlington's Hill.  At dusk the Union attackers withdrew to
  McDowell.

  Phase Five.  Union Withdrawal (9 May): At dark US forces
  withdrew from Sitlington's Hill and recrossed to McDowell,
  carrying their wounded from the field.  About 0200 hours of 9
  May, Schenck and Milroy ordered a general retreat along the
  turnpike toward Franklin.  The 73rd Ohio held their skirmish line
  along the river until near dawn when they withdrew and acted as
  rear guard for the retreating column.  Ten men of the regiment
  were inadvertently left behind and captured.  Shortly after the
  Federals retired, the Confederates entered McDowell.  Schenck
  established a holding position on 9 May (north of modern
  intersection of rte. 629 and US 220) but only minor skirmishing
  resulted.  For nearly a week, Jackson pursued the retreating
  Union army almost to Franklin before commencing a return march to
  the Valley on 15 May.

  Current Condition of the Battlefield

  The battlefield of McDowell retains the highest integrity of all
  of the Shenandoah Valley battlefields surveyed; this is due to
  its location and the rugged nature of the ground, which precludes
  almost any land use other than agriculture or woodland.  Highland
  County retains a low population density (fewer residents now than
  at the time of the battle) and a distinct rural character.  In
  general, the landscape consists of narrow river valleys which are
  farmed and high ridge lines which are mostly forested with
  interspersed pastureland.  The line of Jackson's advance along
  rte. 250 passes through the George Washington National Forest,
  which ends at the Cowpasture River.  The core of the battlefield
  on Sitlington's Hill is owned and preserved by the Association
  for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS) and the Lee-
  Jackson Foundation.  Together the two groups own more than 200
  acres bounded by rte. 250 on the east and north, including the
  ravine used by CS troops to reach the summit and main areas of
  attack and defense.  A single individual owns the remaining
  portions of Sitlington's Hill.  A hiking trail on APCWS property
  leads to the crest of Sitlington's Hill, providing unmarked
  access for visitors.

  The village of McDowell retains much character, including many
  historic structures: a renovated mill next to the bridge,
  Presbyterian Church (used as a field hospital by both sides), and
  the Hull House (Federal headquarters).  The general store and
  other structures appear to date from about 1900.  Hull's Hill
  north of rte. 250 is privately owned; its crest is maintained as
  pastureland as at the time of the battle, while its slopes and
  base are heavily wooded.

  Perception of Threats to Battlefield
  The general perception is that the battlefield of McDowell was
  substantially preserved by the recent APCWS acquisition of about
  100 acres on Sitlington's Hill.  The county's economy is
  sluggish, compared with that of the Shenandoah Valley proper, and
  little development of any kind is present.  The county prides
  itself on its annual Highland Maple Festival, which attracts
  thousands of visitors every spring.  Local residents are content
  that ``their battlefield'' is in one piece, and many expressed
  the desire that more tourists could be attracted to McDowell to
  visit it.  The Hull House is currently occupied seasonally and
  the structure appears in good condition.
