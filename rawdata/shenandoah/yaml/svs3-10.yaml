Significance: >-

  In the first weeks of July 1864, Lt. Gen.
  Jubal A. Early raided Maryland with an army of about 14,000 men,
  defeated a US force at the battle of Monocacy (9 July), and
  marched on Washington D.C.  Confronted there on 12 July by US
  veterans diverted from the Army of the Potomac, Early retreated,
  crossing the Potomac River at White's Ferry and the Blue Ridge at
  Snickers Gap.  Elements of three US corps (about 25,000 men)
  under overall command of Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright pursued and met
  Early's rear guard at the Shenandoah River crossing of Snickers
  Ferry near the farm of Cool Spring.  Although brief in duration,
  the battle of Cool Spring was desperately fought, checking US
  pursuit for several days.  The battle of Cool Spring (also known
  as Snickers Ferry or Parker's Ford) is representative of the
  division-sized engagements that occurred almost weekly throughout
  the remainder of the 1864 Valley Campaign, including Rutherford's
  Farm (20 July), Guard Hill (16 August), Abrams Creek (17 August),
  Cameron's Depot and Summit Point (21 August), Smithfield Crossing
  (29 August), and Berryville (3-4 September).  These encounters
  led up to the decisive battle of Opequon (Third Winchester) on 19
  September.

"Description of the Battle": >-

  Phase One: Skirmishing at Snickers Ford (17 July): On the
  afternoon of 17 July 1864, the US cavalry division of Alfred
  Duffi‚ reached Snickers Ford and attempted to force a crossing of
  the Shenandoah River.  Two regiments of CS infantry supported by
  two` pieces of artillery positioned on North Hill overlooking the
  ford repulsed the attempt.  US cavalry then tried to cross at
  Shepherd's Ford about two miles south but were repulsed by CS
  cavalry of Vaughn's brigade.  During the night, Duffi‚ continued
  south along the river, leaving a smaller force to picket the
  fords.  On the morning of 18 July, US cavalry pickets, supported
  by Mulligan's brigade of infantry (Crook's corps) again attempted
  a crossing at Snickers Ford but were repulsed.

  Phase Two: Advance of US Infantry (18 July): Col.
  Thoburn's division of Crook's Corps, followed by the VI Corps
  arrived on the Berryville Pike (current rte. 7) from their
  bivouac near Purcellville.  Union generals Wright, Emory, and
  Crook conferred on River Hill, where they established a signal
  station and brought up a battery of artillery.  It was assumed
  that General Early's CS army was in retreat to Winchester and
  that the ford was defended only by cavalry.  Because the
  attempted crossing at Snickers Ford in the morning had been
  unsuccessful, the US commanders decided to cross a division one
  mile downstream.  The infantry diverged from the main road onto a
  rocky cart road that led to Judge Parker's house, mill, and ford.
  The intervening hills disguised the movement from the CS pickets
  on the west bank of the river.

  Phase Three: River Crossing (18 July): About 1500 hours,
  Thoburn's 3,250 infantrymen forced CS skirmishers back from
  Parker's Ford and crossed the shallow river at a number of places
  across and between the islands.  Once on the west bank, US
  skirmishers fanned out across the Cool Spring farm, while the
  main body deployed along a rise about 100 yards from the river in
  the midst of a large wheatfield.  Commands regrouped after the
  crossing and prepared to move south to uncover Snickers Ford. 
  Captured Confederates, however, revealed that the island fords
  had been defended by infantry and that Early's army was nearby. 
  Thoburn alerted his superiors on River Hill (by signal flag and
  courier) and awaited further instructions.  He was told that he
  would be supported by a division of the VI Corps, which had begun
  to arrive on the east bank near the Parker House.
    
  Phase Four: CS Response (18 July): In response to
  Thoburn's crossing (or in anticipation of it) Maj. Gen. John B.
  Gordon's division advanced along the Berryville Pike from its
  bivouac at Webbtown.  Gordon deployed along the river bluffs
  north and south of North Hill.  Simultaneously, Brig. Gen.
  Gabriel Wharton's division moved toward Cool Spring from its
  bivouac near Wickliffe Church.  Wharton deployed in line of
  battle and advanced on Cool Spring forcing back the US
  skirmishers to their main line near the river.  Maj. Gen. Robert
  E. Rodes's division was farther north at Gaylord but was set in
  motion to come up on the left of Wharton.  Skirmishing extended
  along Wharton's and Gordon's fronts.

  Phase Five: Rodes's Flank Attack (18 July): Colonel Thoburn was
  now aware of his precarious position but hoped to hold out until
  reinforced or withdrawn after dark.  Rodes's division arrived
  from Wickliffe Church, moving through ravines and behind the
  grove at Westwood which concealed the movement of the troops
  until they were within striking distance of Thoburn's contracted
  line.  Rodes deployed to Wharton's left, his line bending in an
  arc almost at right angles to the river and the US right flank. 
  About 1800 hours Rodes threw his division forward on a compact
  front, surprising and crushing the US right.
  
  Thoburn sent the 116th Ohio to reinforce his right as both sides
  struggled for possession of a stone fence that bisected the
  wheatfield.  A second CS attack drove US forces back to another
  stone fence along the river bank.  There, they held out against a
  third desperate CS attack that came near to driving them into the
  river.  Three batteries of Union artillery came into play from
  the heights on the east bank.  A division of the VI Corps
  deployed on the east bank and engaged in sharpshooting, but it
  was not sent across the river.  Three batteries of CS artillery
  supported Rodes's attack.  Colonel Owens, commanding a CS brigade
  was mortally wounded.  The bulk of the almost 850 casualties of
  the battle occurred at this time and littered the wheatfield.

  Phase Six: US Withdrawal (18 July): The Union line held
  out until dark, then began to recross the river unmolested by CS
  infantry.  An artillery duel broke out across the river.  US and
  CS batteries fired at each others' positions, guided by the
  flashes of discharge and explosion.  When US infantry was safely
  on the east bank, the artillery fire tapered off, ending about
  2100 hours.  Later CS skirmishers advanced to the river, finding
  the Union line abandoned.  CS units spread out across the field
  to tend to the wounded of both sides.  General Crook was angered
  that Thoburn's command had been left to their own devices without
  being reinforced by the VI Corps, which was at hand.

"Current Condition of the Battlefield": >-


  The setting of Cool Spring battlefield at the base of the Blue
  Ridge and on both banks of the Shenandoah River is very scenic. 
  The combination of rural condition and standing historic
  structures invokes a strong historic atmosphere.  The core area
  of the battlefield (where infantry attacks occurred) is private
  property owned by Holy Cross Abbey.  Buildings have been added on
  abbey grounds and Cool Spring mansion has been enlarged, but
  these additions, although visually intrusive, do not interfere
  with interpretation of the battle.  The recently constructed
  Abbey Retreat House sits astride the CS battle line and overlooks
  the main battlefield.  The wheatfield and river bank where the
  major infantry fighting occurred are in pristine condition.  The
  abbey does accommodate visitors to the battlefield with prior
  arrangement.
  
  US approach routes along rte. 7 from Snickers Gap have been
  altered but not so that the strategy of movement is lost.  US
  staging and deployment areas on the east bank in the vicinity of
  the Parker House are private property owned by Golf Links, Inc. 
  Approaches to the fords here were recontoured for a previous golf
  course, which has been out of business for some years.  US
  artillery positions on the bluffs overlooking the river have been
  developed for a low-density housing project (Shenandoah Retreat).
  Access to this portion of the battlefield is restricted due to
  private ownership.

  The general area contains many Civil War-era structures,
  including the Judge Parker House (judge who sentenced John
  Brown), North Hill, Riverside farm and tenant house, the old
  Snickers House, Waterloo, Cool Spring, and Wickliffe Church,
  besides other historic estates within a radius of several
  miles--Audley, Auburn, Clermont.  These structures reveal the
  plantation-style settlement pattern characteristic of this part
  of the Shenandoah Valley.  Remains of Westwood House near the
  Abbey can be located.  Remnants of stone fences used in the
  battle remain or old alignments can be traced.  Access roads to
  fords can be traced on the east and west banks.

  The field surveyor rated this field fair, while GIS rated it
  good.  The field surveyor made deductions for the fourlane
  highway bridge, the recontoured ground on the east bank, housing
  on battery heights, and the modern retreat house which dominates
  many views from inside the core.

"Perception of Threats to Battlefield": >-

  The east bank of the battlefield is occupied by the Shenandoah
  Retreat development and a former golf course.  These areas were
  used for US staging and deployment in preparation of crossing the
  river and for the Union artillery positions.  The area was under
  fire from Confederate batteries.  It is uncertain how the planned
  redevelopment of the golf course by Golf Links, Inc., would
  impact battlefield integrity.  The east bank has already been
  substantially recontoured for the previous golf course upstream
  from the Parker House.

  There has a long-standing controversy in the county among those
  who wish to redevelop the golf course and those who oppose
  further development in the area.  Golf Links did receive zoning
  from the county to go ahead with redevelopment, but as yet major
  construction has not begun.  A spokesman for the Holy Cross Abbey
  has suggested that the monastery might be forced to relocate to a
  more secluded place in response to the ``loss of privacy'' caused
  by encroaching development.  Residents of Shenandoah Retreat, on
  the other hand, have complained in the past about loud, raucous
  drinking parties along the river when the golf course was closed.
  
  As a result, many residents support redevelopment of the golf
  course.  (It should be noted that public access to the Shenandoah
  River in this area is very restricted.) A spokesman for Golf
  Links, Inc., said that the owners were interested in
  incorporating a display and a possible walking trail into the new
  golf course design to help interpret the battle of Cool Spring. 
  The Judge Parker House (with existing additions) will serve as
  the club house for the golf course, if redevelopment proceeds.

  At least two new housing tracts, featuring large houses on one-
  to three-acre lots have appeared along rte. 7 west of North Hill
  in the last several years.  Although these tracts are not within
  the battlefield study area, they are representative of the type
  of development that is occurring in this area.
