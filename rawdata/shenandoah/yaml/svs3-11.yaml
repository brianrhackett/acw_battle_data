Significance: >-

  In late June and early July 1864, Lt. Gen.
  Jubal A. Early's Confederate army used the strategic Shenandoah
  Valley corridor to terrorize Maryland, defeat a Union army at
  Monocacy, and march on Washington, D.C.  Only the diversion of
  reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac, bogged down in the
  trenches before Petersburg, turned back the invasion.  Early
  returned to the Valley and achieved a decisive victory over
  George Crook's command at Second Kernstown on 24 July.  He
  subsequently sent cavalry to burn Chambersburg, Pennsylvania on
  30 July.  These disasters forced Lt. Gen. U.S. Grant to take
  immediate action to solve the Valley problem.  The VI Corps and
  elements of the XIX Corps were returned to the Valley and united
  with Crook's corps (called the Army of West Virginia). 
  Additional cavalry units were diverted to the Valley.  More
  importantly, Grant unified the various military districts of the
  region into the Middle Military District and appointed Maj. Gen.
  Philip Sheridan as overall commander.  Sheridan took command of
  the newly christened Army of the Shenandoah on 7 August at
  Harpers Ferry.  Sheridan's leadership and his strongly reinforced
  army turned the tide against Confederate power in the Shenandoah
  Valley.

  Rutherford B. Hayes, later president of the United States,
  commanded a brigade during the battle on the left of the US line.
  John C. Breckinridge, former senator and vice president of the
  United States, commanded the Confederate division that confronted
  Hayes.

  
Description of the Battle:

  Phase One: Skirmishing at Kernstown (23 July): On the
  afternoon of 23 July 1864, CS cavalry advanced aggressively down
  the Valley Pike, driving US cavalry from Newtown (Stephens City)
  to Kernstown.  Brig. Gen. George Crook directed Duval's infantry
  division to deploy across the pike and clear the town of
  Confederates, which they did with little difficulty.  Crook then
  withdrew his infantry to Winchester behind Abrams Creek, leaving
  a brigade of cavalry to picket Kernstown.  The CS army encamped
  in the vicinity of Strasburg with headquarters at the Kendricks'
  House: Ramseur at Capon Grade, Rodes at Fisher's Mill, Wharton
  and Gordon on Hupp's Hill.  The CS cavalry withdrew to the
  vicinity of Newtown.

  Phase Two: Advance of CS Infantry (24 July): At first
  light, the CS infantry left their encampments near Strasburg and
  advanced down the Valley Pike.  At Bartonsville, Ramseur's
  division was directed west on side roads to the Middle Road. 
  Gordon, Wharton, and Rodes continued ahead on the pike.  Early
  sent two columns of cavalry to the east and west on a wide-
  ranging maneuver to converge on Winchester and the Federal rear. 
  Cavalry led the advance down the pike, coming up against the main
  US force at Kernstown about 1000 hours.  About noon, the vanguard
  of the CS infantry reached Kernstown.  Gordon deployed to the
  left of the Valley Pike, Wharton to the right.  Ramseur deployed
  across the Middle Road at Mrs. Massie's house.  Rodes moved east
  from the Pike, following a ravine.
  
  Phase Three: US Deployment on Pritchard's Hill: Crook
  received information that Early's army was approaching and
  brought two of his three divisions into line just north of Hoge's
  Run at Kernstown.  Mulligan's division held the US center behind
  a stone fence at the Pritchard House, supported by Capt. Henry
  DuPont's artillery massed on Pritchard's Hill to his rear. 
  Duval's two brigades were separated and posted on Mulligan's
  flanks with Hayes' brigade extending the US line east of the
  Valley Pike.  A strong skirmish line was posted near Opequon
  Church.  Thoburn's division was held in reserve on Pritchard's
  Hill to the right rear of the main US line.  Cavalry protected
  both flanks.

  Phase Four: CS Attack on Center: About noon, Gordon's
  division advanced in line west of the pike, driving back the
  skirmishers and closing with the main US line in the vicinity of
  Opequon Church.  Mulligan's division counterattacked, supported
  by Hayes on his left and took possession of the churchyard. 
  Soldiers sheltered there from the intense firing behind stone
  fences and headstones in the cemetery.  Gordon regrouped and
  again advanced, compelling Mulligan to fall back 250 yards to the
  stone fence along Pritchard's Lane.  Gordon reached Opequon
  Church but could make no further headway.  CS artillery was
  brought up south of the church to engage US artillery on
  Pritchard's Hill.  One of Wharton's brigades came into line on
  Gordon's right.  Crook repositioned his forces.  Duval's right
  flank brigade was moved west, astride Middle Road.  Thoburn's
  division was brought forward to fill the gap between Mulligan and
  Duval.  Elements of Duffi‚'s cavalry supported the right flank on
  the Middle Road and picketed Cedar Creek Grade to the west.
  
  Phase Five: CS Attack on Left: Ramseur's division came
  into line from the Middle Road on Gordon's left and advanced. 
  Gordon shifted a brigade to the open ground west of Opequon
  Church and advanced against Thoburn in conjunction with Ramseur. 
  Without orders Gordon's brigade attacked and dislodged US troops
  sheltering behind two stone fences.  Thoburn withdrew to the base
  of Pritchard's Hill, bending his line back to the north and
  exposing Mulligan's right flank.  Ramseur advanced in force,
  wheeling right to confront Thoburn's line and bringing a heavy
  enfilade fire against Mulligan's line.

  Phase Six: CS Attack on Right: Wharton's division moved
  along the ridge east of the Pike to threaten the US left flank
  held by Hayes.  Elements of Averell's cavalry division were in
  position to delay this maneuver but withdrew without engaging. 
  In conjunction with Ramseur's advance on the CS left, Wharton
  attacked about 1500 hours and quickly turned the US left.  Hayes
  retreated to the stone walls that lined the Valley Pike and
  rallied his brigade, facing east at right angles to the center
  held by Mulligan.

  Phase Seven: US Retreat: Three CS divisions now moved in
  concert to envelope the US center.  Mulligan's division was under
  fire from three directions.  While trying to direct the defense,
  Mulligan himself was pierced by five mini‚ balls and fell
  mortally wounded.  ``Lay me down and save the colors!'' he
  snapped at the officers who tried to assist him.  The US center
  collapsed, and soldiers began streaming to the rear.  Hayes'
  brigade stood long enough on the crest of Pritchard's Hill to
  allow the US artillery to escape.  Elements of Duffi‚'s cavalry
  made a brief counterattack along the Middle Road, buying time for
  Thoburn's division to retire in relatively good order.
  
  Phase Eight: Rear Guard Actions: A brigade of Thoburn's
  division made a stand near the toll gate at the intersection of
  the Valley Pike and Cedar Creek Grade, while the rest of Crook's
  infantry retreated through the streets of Winchester.  Rodes'
  division, in the meantime, crossed from the Valley Pike to the
  Front Royal Road and marched north to cut off the Federal
  retreat, meeting only light opposition from the US cavalry. 
  Rodes followed the Federal forces north to Stephenson's Depot,
  taking hundreds of prisoners until darkness ended the pursuit. 
  The CS cavalry did not advance as Early expected.  The
  disorganized Federal army retreated to Bunker Hill where it
  regrouped.  Crook continued the retreat before dawn and
  eventually reached the Potomac River on 27 July.  For a few days
  after the battle, Federal prisoners were held in Star Fort.

Current Condition of the Battlefield: >-

  The core of the battlefield, the US center and goal of decisive
  CS assaults, is Pritchard's Hill and the Pritchard Farm, owned by
  the Charles Hardy Grim Estate.  The ``Pritchard-Grim'' property
  (roughly from rte. 652 to Pritchard's Hill and from rte. 628 to
  the historic Opequon Church, about 200 acres) is agricultural
  land that retains a marked similarity to its Civil War
  appearance.  The property features a fine brick antebellum
  structure (Pritchard House), a frame tenant house, and several
  outbuildings that date from the time of the battle.  Col. James
  Mulligan, commander of the Union center, was wounded in front of
  and died in the Pritchard House two days after the battle.  The
  stone fence defended by Mulligan's infantry still runs along
  Pritchard's Lane.  CS forces attacked across the open meadow
  south of the house.  Pritchard's Hill served as a Union artillery
  strongpoint and was assaulted directly during the battle's
  closing phases.

  Opequon Church was the focal point of initial fighting; the
  original building was destroyed during the war but rebuilt in
  1896.  Union accounts describe firing from behind tombstones in
  the cemetery.  An adjacent parcel (bounded by rte. 37, Cedar
  Creek Grade, and Middle Road to the Winchester city limits) is
  primarily agricultural with some new residences along Middle Road
  and Cedar Creek Grade.  This land, about 275 acres, was
  significant during First Kernstown, and was the location of the
  US far right at Second Kernstown, anchored on Sand Ridge until
  turned by Ramseur's advance.  Of about 2,200 acres of battlefield
  core, excluding Rodes' pursuit and cavalry actions, an estimated
  625 acres of contiguous open ground remains.

  Ramseur's deployment area on Middle Road is bisected by the four-
  lane rte. 37-bypass.  Gordon's deployment area is occupied by an
  industrial building and a housing subdivision.  The area where
  Wharton made his decisive flanking movement and attack Rutherford
  B. Hayes' brigade is occupied by a high density industrial park
  along US 11 and the railroad corridor.  Dense industrial and
  commercial development characterizes the land adjacent to and
  east of US 11.  The Pritchard-Grim property and Pritchard's Hill
  are the last portions of open ground south of the Winchester city
  limits.

  Most historic buildings of old Kernstown have been lost, with the
  notable exception of Hoge's Ordinary or Beemer's Tavern, which
  has been renovated into office space and anchors a five-acre
  office-commercial development.  Taylor provides a useful drawing
  of this structure in his sketchbook.  The Frederick County
  Historical Society has recently erected new interpretive signs
  and a map adjacent to Opequon Church, making the action more
  comprehensible to visitors.

Perception of Threats to the Battlefield:

  Land east of US 11 (Valley Pike) along the railroad tracks has
  been developed for a large-scale industrial/business park.  Route
  11 is zoned commercial/industrial and has been densely developed
  from south of Kernstown to the Winchester city limits, causing
  concern over potential development plans west of the highway.  A
  new business/office park was recently constructed near the
  entrance to the Opequon Church with Hoge's Ordinary as its center
  piece.

  A county planning official noted, however, that watershed and
  ground water considerations make development in the Pritchard's
  Hill and Sand Ridge areas less desirable.  These factors would
  need to be considered before any development plans would be
  approved.  Residential development is encroaching on the northern
  part of Pritchard's Hill.  For the present, a large portion of
  this land remains in private ownership and has been altered
  little since the Civil War.  The Pritchard-Grim farm and adjacent
  portions of Pritchard's Hill are owned by the Charles Hardy Grim
  Estate.
