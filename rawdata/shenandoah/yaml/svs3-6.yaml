Significance: >-
   The battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic
   were the culmination of ``Stonewall'' Jackson's Valley Campaign
   in which Jackson maneuvered to defeat superior Union forces by
   surprise, swift marching, and concentration of force.  In May and
   June, Jackson's Army of the Valley, which never exceeded 17,000
   men, inflicted more than 7,000 casualties on his opponents at a
   cost of only 2,500 of his own men, and tied up Union forces three
   times its strength.  Jackson's victories infused new hope in the
   Confederate cause and contributed to the defeat of McClellan's
   campaign against Richmond.   The battle of Port Republic was a
   fierce contest between two equally determined foes and was the
   most costly battle fought by the Army of the Valley during its
   campaign.  At its conclusion, Union forces withdrew down the
   Valley, freeing Jackson's command to go to the aid of the CS army
   facing Maj. Gen. George McClellan's army in front of Richmond.
   
   
Description of the Battle: >-
   
   Phase One.  Dispositions of the Armies: During the night
   of 8-9 June 1862, Winder's ``Stonewall'' Brigade was withdrawn
   from its forward position near Bogota and rejoined Jackson's
   division at Port Republic.  CS pioneers built a bridge of wagons
   across the South River at Port Republic.  Winder's brigade was
   assigned the task of spearheading the assault against US forces
   south of the river.  Trimble's brigade and elements of Patton's
   were left to delay Fremont's forces at Cross Keys, while the rest
   of Ewell's division marched to Port Republic to be in position to
   support Winder's attack. 
   
   Phase Two.  US Deployment: Brig. Gen. E. B. Tyler's
   brigade joined Col. Samuel Carroll's brigade north of Lewiston on
   the Luray Road. The rest of Shields's division was strung out
   along the muddy roads back to Luray.  General Tyler, in command
   on the field, advanced at dawn of 9 June to the vicinity of
   Lewiston.  He anchored the left of his line on a battery
   positioned on the Lewiston Coaling, extending his infantry west
   along Lewiston Lane (present day rte. 708) to the South Fork near
   the site of Lewis' Mill.  The right and center were supported by
   artillery (16 guns in all).
   
   Phase Three.  CS Advance on the Left and Center: Winder's
   brigade crossed the river by 0500 hours and deployed to attack
   east across the bottomland.  Winder sent two regiments (2VA and
   4VA) into the woods to flank the US line and assault the Coaling.
   When the main CS battle line advanced, it came under heavy fire
   from the US artillery and was soon pinned down.  CS batteries
   were brought forward onto the plain but were outgunned and forced
   to seek safer positions.  Ewell's brigades were hurried forward
   to cross the river.  Seeing the strength of the US artillery at
   the Coaling, Jackson sent Taylor's brigade to the right into the
   woods to support the flanking column that was attempting to
   advance through the thick underbrush.
   
   Phase Four.  US Counterattack: Winder's brigade renewed
   its assault on the US right and center, taking heavy casualties. 
   General Tyler moved two regiments from the Coaling to his right
   and launched a counterattack, driving CS forces back nearly half
   a mile.  While this was occurring, the first CS regiments probed
   the defenses of the Coaling but were repulsed.
   
   Phase Five.  Fighting at the Coaling: Finding resistance
   more fierce than anticipated, Jackson ordered the last of Ewell's
   forces still north of Port Republic to cross the rivers and burn
   the North Fork bridge.  These reinforcements began to reach
   Winder, strengthening his line and stopping the US counterattack.
   
   Taylor's brigade reached a position in the woods across from the
   Coaling and launched a fierce attack, which carried the hill,
   capturing five guns.  Tyler immediately responded with a
   counterattack, using his reserves.  These regiments, in hand-to-
   hand fighting, retook the position.  Taylor shifted a regiment to
   the far right to outflank the US battle line.  The CS attack
   again surged forward to capture the Coaling.  Five captured guns
   were turned against the rest of the Union line.  With the loss of
   the Coaling, the Union position along Lewiston Lane became
   untenable, and Tyler ordered a withdrawal about 1030 hours. 
   Jackson ordered a general advance.
   
   Phase Six.  Tyler's Retreat/Fremont's Advance:
   Taliaferro's fresh CS brigade arrived from Port Republic and
   pressed the retreating Federals for several miles north along the
   Luray Road, taking several hundred prisoners.  The Confederate
   army was left in possession of the field.  Shortly after noon,
   Fremont's army began to deploy on the north bank of the South
   Fork, too late to aid Tyler's defeated command.  Fremont deployed
   artillery on the high bluffs to harass the CS forces.  Jackson
   gradually withdrew along a narrow road through the woods and
   concentrated his army in the vicinity of Mt. Vernon Furnace. 
   Jackson expected Fremont to cross the river and attack him on the
   following day, but during the night Fremont withdrew toward
   Harrisonburg.
   
   
Current Condition of the Battlefield: >-
   
   The setting of Port Republic battlefield, along the South Fork
   Shenandoah River at the base of the forested Blue Ridge, is very
   scenic.  From some locations the base of Massanutten Mountain can
   be seen to the north.  The core of the battlefield of Port
   Republic extends from the village of Port Republic east to rte.
   708, which approximately traces the main US battle line.  The old
   Luray-Port Republic Road followed rte. 955 north from the village
   until joining present day US 340.  (US 340 south of this
   intersection is not historic.) The ford over South River where
   Jackson built his ``wagon bridge'' is located just west of the
   confluence of the South and North rivers and can be reached by a
   dirt road off rte. 955.  The North River bridge was at the end of
   rte. 1601.  Fremont's batteries were deployed along the north
   bank of the South Fork, south of Lawyer's Road, in the battle's
   last phase.
   
   The main CS assaults of General Winder were carried out on the
   bottomland between rtes. 955, 708, and the river.  The land
   remains agricultural and retains a strong similarity to its Civil
   War appearance, except for the railroad which was not there at
   the time of the battle (built 1892).  The railroad artificially
   divides the battlefield but does not particularly intrude upon
   most viewsheds.
   
   The Coaling, which was the key to the US defense, is located just
   northeast of the intersection of US 340 and rte. 708.  The
   Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS) owns
   about 8 acres of the Coaling, acquired from the Lee-Jackson
   Foundation.  An 1880s house sits atop the Coaling where US
   batteries were deployed.  Access to this property is encouraged
   but unmarked.
   
   The village of Port Republic is listed as a historic district in
   the National Register.  Several historic structures remain in the
   area, including Lynnwood, Bogota, Frank Kemper House in Port
   Republic, and others.  The Dr. Kemper house at the west edge of
   town, which served as Jackson's headquarters, is no longer
   extant.  The ruin of Mt. Vernon Furnace in the area where
   Jackson's army bivouacked after the battle is situated in
   Shenandoah National Park along rte. 659.  A driving tour of Port
   Republic could be laid out to view the battlefield with stops at
   the village, at the railroad (rte. 708), and the Coaling. 
   Because of the terrain, Port Republic can be interpreted from
   public roads.  The portion of the Coaling preserved by APCWS
   allows an expanded interpretation of the battle.  The areas of
   major infantry fighting along the river are in private hands, but
   the logic of the respective positions can be understood for the
   most part from public roads.
   
Perception of Threats to the Battlefield: >-
  
   The bottomland south of the South Fork in the core area of the
   battlefield is owned by two or three large landowners.  Several
   years ago the county denied one of the landowners a petition to
   establish a gravel quarry, partly because of concerns for
   maintaining battlefield integrity.  Continuing integrity of the
   landscape is dependent upon landowners continuing to farm their
   properties.
