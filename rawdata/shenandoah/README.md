# Shenandoah Valley Battlesite Data

Data from the "Study of Civil War Sites in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia" by the National Park Service
in September 1992: http://www.nps.gov/abpp/shenandoah/svs0-1.html.

This data is later used in the more comprehensive CWSAC Report, although some of the information on the Shenandoah battle is more detailed than that for all battles.
