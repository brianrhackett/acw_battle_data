This table contains data on force sizes taken from the English
Wikipedia pages of American Civil War battles on a few intervals.
These data were entered by hand.  There are much more gaps in the
force data than casualty data, and I have found that the Wikipedia
pages have the most complete coverage of force sizes that I have
found.  Additionally, from my own experience these data appear to be
accurate and well sourced.  Any discrepencies or errors that I noted
were fixed by me on the pages to bring them in line with estimates
from the `Updated CWSAC Reports
<http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/index.htm>`_, if a numerical estimate of
force size is provided in that source.
