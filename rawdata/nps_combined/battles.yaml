    Consider only the Action on July 8 at Boonsboro. There
    are multiple small actions in this area between July 8 and 14.

    Limit the battle to the action at Ware Bottom Church on May 20th.
    The dates in CWSAC2 go to May 29th.

    Limit the battle to the actions at New Hope Chuch on May 25-26.
    This was what https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ga010.htm used.

    Use dates from https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ga011.htm. However,
    battle of Dallas was May 28th only.
