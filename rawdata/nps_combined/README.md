Supplementary data used when combining the NPS datasets (CWSAC Report, CWSAC Report materials, CWSAC Report Updates, CWSS, and Shenanadoah).
Much of this is filling in missing data for a few battles missing from CWSS (WV009, MO010, MO012, MO022).

- `battles.yaml`: additional battle data
- `battleunits.yaml`: additional data for the units in each battle
- `commanders.yaml`: supplementary data for the commanders of each battle. Mostly commanders for battles missing from CWSS, and commanders in CWSAC that were missing from the CWSS commanders.
- `forces.yaml`: supplementary force data
- `persons.yaml`: supplementary person data. This adds person entries for commanders needed for the data but who did not appear in CWSS.
- `extra.yaml`: misc variables used in the code
