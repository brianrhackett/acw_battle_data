The battles considered and the summaries from their pages are copied below.

Charleston Harbor I (SC004) occurred on April 7, 1863, and was a naval
battle between Union ships and the Charleston Harbor forts.

CWSAC Fort Wagner I (SC005)

  On July 10, Union artillery on Folly Island together with Rear
  Adm. John Dahlgren’s fleet of ironclads opened fire on Confederate
  defenses of Morris Island. The bombardment provided cover for
  Brig. Gen. George C. Strong’s brigade, which crossed Light House Inlet
  and landed by boats on the southern tip of the island. Strong’s troops
  advanced, capturing several batteries, to within range of Confederate
  Fort Wagner. At dawn, July 11, Strong attacked the fort. Soldiers of
  the 7th Connecticut reached the parapet but, unsupported, were thrown
  back.   http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/sc005.htm

CWSAC Fort Wagner II (SC007)

  After the July 11 assault on Fort Wagner failed, Gillmore reinforced
  his beachhead on Morris Island. At dusk July 18, Gillmore launched an
  attack spearheaded by the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, a black
  regiment. The unit’s colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, was killed. Members
  of the brigade scaled the parapet but after brutal hand-to-hand combat
  were driven out with heavy casualties. The Federals resorted to siege
  operations to reduce the fort. This was the fourth time in the war
  that black troops played a crucial combat role, proving to skeptics
  that they would fight bravely if only given the chance.

Fort Sumter II (SC008)

  Federal batteries erected on Morris Island opened fire on August 17
  and continued their bombardment of Fort Sumter and the Charleston
  defenses until August 23. Despite a severe pounding, Fort Sumter’s
  garrison held out. Siege operations continued against Fort Wagner on
  Morris Island. http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/sc008.htm

CWSAC Charleston Harbor II (SC009)

  During the night of September 6-7, Confederate forces evacuated Fort
  Wagner and Battery Gregg pressured by advancing Federal
  siegeworks. Federal troops then occupied all of Morris Island. On
  September 8, a storming party of about 400 marines and sailors
  attempted to surprise Fort Sumter. The attack was repulsed.

CWSAC II added the August bombardment of Charleston by the "The Swamp Angel" 
to Charleston Harbor II.

Timeline of July-September events in the  1863 siege of Charleston

- July 10-11. First Battle of Fort Wagner. Failed Union assault.
- July 16. Battle of Grimball's landing. Union defeated in attempt to take Charleston by land.

- Aug 23. Batteries on Morris Island switch bombardment to Fort Wagner.

It seems that the battles break down into the following periods

- July 10-11: First Battle of Fort Wagner (SC005)
- July 16: Battle of Grimball's Landing (SC006)
- July 18: Second Battle of Fort Wagner (SC007)

  Siege of Fort Wagner/Sumter ending with the Confederate abandonment
  of Fort Wagner. (SC008)
- Sept 9 : Second Battle of Fort Sumter (Failed Assault)
- Continued siege??  (SC009)

Thus, confusingly:

- SC009: Charleston Harbor is the `Second Battle of Fort Sumter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Fort_Sumter>`_ .
- SC008: Fort Sumter is the  `Second Battle of Charleston Harbor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Charleston_Harbor>`_ .
