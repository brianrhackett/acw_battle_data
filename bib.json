This study provides a catalog of computerized data bases on personnel casualties and attrition that will be of great value to all who use personnel casualty and attrition data in studies and analyses, weapons evaluation, wargames and simulation, model validation, assessing the utility of protective measures, and so forth. The scope of the study is limited to a selected class of databases. The criteria for inclusion is as follows: The databases must be in the public domain; in database form; contain information on military operations in and/or outcomes of battles or wars; must be available on disk; and will be useful to military operations analysts, developers, users, accessors, and military historians.",

It should be useful to all who need to consider historical attrition rates for the purpose of modeling, war gaming, studies, and analysis. since it includes well over 200 titles, several aids are provided to facilitate its use. First, all documents are given a short title that consists of the principal author’s last name and its date of publication. For example, Hartley-1989c refers to a work by Hartley published in 1989. The added later, c, indicates that the document referred to is the third publication in 1989 by this author. These short titles serve as the key document identifiers. Second, Appendix A gives a list if the full document titles in order by these short titles. Third, Appendix B gives a short subject index to the documents, classified by selected subject categories. Fourth, Appendix C gives a key word index to the full titles arranged alphabetically by the key words they contain. The annotated bibliography itself is in Appendix D, arranged in order by the short titles described above.",

    "abstract": "The magnitude and effects of the inflation that ravaged the Southern Confederacy have been well documented. However, there has never been any formal statistical analysis of the inflationary consequences of its monetary and fiscal policies. This paper utilizes data from the original Treasury reports to investigate the implications of war-induced fiscal expansion for debt and note issues, and for the inflation rate. The former are found to be influenced primarily by the state of the Confederate budget, while the inflation rate appears to be driven by a “confidence” index tied to developments on the military front.",
