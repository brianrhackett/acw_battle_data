Bodart (1908) data on battles of the American Civil War

These data are from Bodart (1908) *Militär-Historisches Kreigs-Lexicon (1618-1905)*.
The *Kriegs-Lexicon* includes over 600 battles from European wars 1618--1905.

  The most important Engagements, meetings, battles, sieges,
  assaults, capitulations all wars, with the exception of the colonial
  wars in periods of 1618-1905.

This data only includes the 50 battles that are part of the American Civil War (Nordamerikanischer Bürgerkrieg), pp. 522-542.

His criteria for including battles in his list is that they were either

  - of great consequences, e.g. termination of a campaign, lifting a siege, taking a capital city or surrender
  - or involved great number of losses

    - land battle: Losses of greater than 2,000 men on both sides
    - sea battle: Because sea battles had fewer men, some with losses of less than 1000 were included.

Bodart determines the victor of the battle as follows

1. the side that claimed the battlefield or achieved purpose of fighting
2. else, the side which had a lower percentage of casualties 
   
In his figues of force strength, Bodart includes all forces that could
be disposable for the battle, even if they did not participate. His
reasoning is that even if not used, they influence the disposition and
tactics of the enemy.

His description of the data (p. 45-47, Google Books translation from German to English):

    On admission, the statistically treated battles meeting, sieges,
    etc., the author has been guided by the principle that only those
    battles were included, who have played in the history of
    individual states a greater role.

    There were so taken up such fights, which attracted great
    consequences for themselves (such as termination of the campaign,
    lifting a siege, taking a capital city, surrender, and so forth),
    or without regard to such consequences such battles, which, either
    by the Assembly of a large number of combatants on the battlefield
    or as result of their great losses appeared worthy of inclusion.

    As a basis for the great loss by the host position to be taken to
    the author, the total loss figure of 2,000 men served together on
    both sides.

    An exception was held regarding the naval battles and Seetreffen,
    even those which were taken up by what were only 1,000 men or less
    of total loss and for the reason, because the author wanted the
    neglected, fighting to give the lake one of its important place.

    In the naval battles of modern wars has been the tonnage of the
    ships, the number of indicated horse-power of the machines, the
    size, type and number of guns, and the Bemannungsstand
    account. With the loss of information in addition to human losses
    appear the ship's gun and loss account.

    The place of the victor in the comparisons is always on the left
    side, the search for the right of the vanquished.  In so-called
    indecisive battles that party was considered a winner, which
    claimed the battlefield or the purpose sought by the fighting
    reached, even if their material loss was greater. If the above
    factors were not available, the party was given the victory, which
    scored a minority of the same success as her opponent with a
    larger Struiterzahl.  Since the loss data provide absolute figures
    for the size of the sustained loss of any scale for the
    comparative assessment was performed in all loss of Perzentsatz
    determined the same by the G esam t-Strei terzah 1, which allows
    an immediate comparison of the enemy's losses to their relative
    amount is.

    Where it was feasible, the loss of trophies and
    war material were attached.  

    When the strength data were always armed forces led those who were
    the battle for disposable and emergency could be used, therefore,
    still in and not just those who were really in the fight. Author
    went here from consideration of that that even that of a number of
    troops at a the field of battle not too distant places the
    opponent in his dispositions affect and presence on the course of
    events influence affect could, therefore those troops if they are
    also on the fight and the decision took no share, were included.

Bodart classifies battles into the following cateogies:

- Einnahme : taking
- Treffen : meeting, encounter
- Schlacht : battle
- Kapitulation : surrender
- Erstürmung : storming
- Einschliessung : confinement
- Gefecht :  battle
- Überfall : raid
- Vergebliche belagerung : unsuccessful siege
- Seeschlacht : naval battle 

These battle types are placed into 4 larger categories (see pp 602-607) with subcategories.

- "Land-schlachten, -Treffen, -Gefechte" ("land battles")
- "See-Schlachten, -Treffen, -Gefechte" ("sea battles")
- "Angriff, Erstürmung, Belagerung, Kapitulation befestigter Plätse" ("Attack, assault, siege, capitulation fortified places")
- "Kapitulation auf freiem Felde ("surrenders (not after a siege)")

There is also a category entitled "Summe der"

- Kämpfe zu Lande ("battles on land")
- Kämpfe zur See ("battles at sea")
- Belagerungen ("siege")
- Kapitulation ("surrender")

Final total category "Gesamtsumme der Kämpfe" ("total fights")

- "die bedeutendsten niederlagen der Foo gegen die Bar" : "the most significant defeats of Foo against Bar"
- "die größten Siege der Foo gegen die Bar" : "the biggest victories of Foo against Bar"

Corrections

- Bodart listed the date of the Battle of Ringgold as 1863-11-13 to 1863-11-25; I changed this to 
  1863-11-23 to 1863-11-25, the correct dates for this battle.

Several "battles" in Bodart are campaigns.  For exmample, Petersburg
spans June 9, 1864 (First Battle of Petersburg) to April 3, 1865
(capture of Petersburg after the Third Battle of Petersburg). This
includes parts of the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign and Appomattox
Campaign. 

While most entries are presented in an almost tabular form, some
entries only have a paragraph of text.  An example of this is from
p. 528, Schlacht bei Perryville,

 Sieg der Konföderierten (68.000 M.) unter Gen. Bragg über die Unierten
 (54.000 M.) unter GM. Buell. 

The Google Books translation of this passage is 

 Victory for the Confederates (68,000 meters) under General. Bragg on the Uniate
 (54,000 meters) in GM. Buell."

The relevant data that I extract from this text is,

- Confederates are the victor
- Confederate force
  - gesamt-starke = 68000
  - commander = "Gen. Bragg"
- Union force
  - gesamt-starke = 54000
  - commander "GM. Buell"
