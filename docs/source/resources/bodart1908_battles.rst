Bodart (1908) *Militär-historisches kreigs-lexikon* data on battles of the American Civil War

These data are from Bodart (1908) *Militär-Historisches Kreigs-Lexicon (1618-1905)*.
The *Kreigs-Lexicon* includes over 600 battles from European wars 1618--1905.

  The most important Engagements, meetings, battles, sieges,
  assaults, capitulations all wars, with the exception of the colonial
  wars in periods of 1618-1905.

This data only includes the 50 battles that are part of the American Civil War (pp. 522-542, ).
In Bodart, the war is called Nordamerikanischer Bürgerkrieg, the Conderacy is referred to as Konföderierten (Suudstaaten), and the US as Unierten (Nordstaaten).

His criteria for including battles in his list is that they were either

  - of great consequences, e.g. termination of a campaign, lifting a siege, taking a capital city or surrender
  - or involved great number of losses

    - land battle: Losses of greater than 2,000 men on both sides
    - sea battle: Because sea battles had fewer men, some with losses of less than 1,000 were included.

Bodart determines the victor of the battle as follows

1. the side that claimed the battlefield or achieved purpose of fighting
2. else, the side which had a lower percentage of casualties 
   
His description of the data (p. 45-47, Google Books translation from German to English):

    On admission, the statistically treated battles meeting, sieges,
    etc., the author has been guided by the principle that only those
    battles were included, who have played in the history of
    individual states a greater role.

    There were so taken up such fights, which attracted great
    consequences for themselves (such as termination of the campaign,
    lifting a siege, taking a capital city, surrender, and so forth),
    or without regard to such consequences such battles, which, either
    by the Assembly of a large number of combatants on the battlefield
    or as result of their great losses appeared worthy of inclusion.

    As a basis for the great loss by the host position to be taken to
    the author, the total loss figure of 2,000 men served together on
    both sides.

    An exception was held regarding the naval battles and Seetreffen,
    even those which were taken up by what were only 1,000 men or less
    of total loss and for the reason, because the author wanted the
    neglected, fighting to give the lake one of its important place.

    In the naval battles of modern wars has been the tonnage of the
    ships, the number of indicated horse-power of the machines, the
    size, type and number of guns, and the Bemannungsstand
    account. With the loss of information in addition to human losses
    appear the ship's gun and loss account.

    The place of the victor in the comparisons is always on the left
    side, the search for the right of the vanquished.  In so-called
    indecisive battles that party was considered a winner, which
    claimed the battlefield or the purpose sought by the fighting
    reached, even if their material loss was greater. If the above
    factors were not available, the party was given the victory, which
    scored a minority of the same success as her opponent with a
    larger Struiterzahl.  Since the loss data provide absolute figures
    for the size of the sustained loss of any scale for the
    comparative assessment was performed in all loss of Perzentsatz
    determined the same by the G esam t-Strei terzah 1, which allows
    an immediate comparison of the enemy's losses to their relative
    amount is.

    Where it was feasible, the loss of trophies and
    war material were attached.  

    The strength information those forces were always given, which
    were disposable for battle, and therefore in an emergency could
    still be used, and not merely those which really came into the
    fight. The author went here based on the consideration that even
    the presence of a number of troops at one of the battle-field not
    too distant places affect the enemy in his dispositions, and could
    act affecting the course of events, therefore, those troops when
    they where also fight and the decision took no part, were
    included.
    
    The next to each conflict in the parentheses point to emphasize
    its meaning at first glance in the manner that the paragraph in
    question "Lio category called, in which ranks of battle.
    
    For the rank classification or categories of fighting, the total
    amount of losses (bloody and bloodless) both opponents were
    decisive for the author, taken together, u. ZW. Range from the

    Fight on land in the
    
    - 1st category, those in which the total casualties reached at least 30,000
    - 2nd category ... 20,000
    - 3rd category ... 10,000
    - 4th category ... 5,000
    - 5th category ... 3,000
    - 6th category ... 1,000      

    In the battles at sea in the

    - 1st category, those in which the total casualties reached at least 10,000
    - 2nd category ... 5,000
    - 3rd category ... 3,000
    - 4th category ... 2,000
    - 5th category ... 1,000
    - 6th category ... 500      

    Left the battles which the first three categories innate (about
    250 in number), and which represent the greatest fights of modern
    times and the most recent time, was already at the point where
    they reach the treatise, a bouncing into your eyes preferably
    sooner so that readers will point out at once that he has to do
    here with a meaningful fight.
      
    The strength and casualty figures have been rounded up by the
    author after u. Btw. In such a way that a number of less than 50
    men on 50, such a of less than 100 men were rounded down to 100.

And on page 601:

   With regard to the rank classification of fighting in six
   categories, is with regard to the land battles, and -meeting
   -Gefechte, and referenced with respect to the sea-battles,
   and -meeting -Gefechte to the "Explanatory Preface" in the on page
   47 apparent explanation.
   
   With regard to the rank classification of fights included in the
   column "attack, siege, storming, surrender fortified places" is
   expressly noted that not as the sum total of the mutual losses as a
   basis of classification used in the battles, meetings and
   engagements in these battles, but the strength of the occupation of
   the fortified place in question, so that a besieged fortress with a
   garrison of more than 30,000 men under the struggles 1st order, one
   with 20,000 to 30,000 men in the 2nd order, etc., as set out on
   page 47 included, has been.  With regard to the "capitulations in
   the open field," so the overall strength of the resultant army
   served as the basis for the ranking classification, again after the
   numeral regular gradation of the six categories, as discussed on
   page 47 concerning the fighting on land.

- Gefecht :  battle
- Treffen : meeting, encounter
- Schlacht : battle
- Kapitulation : surrender
- Erstürmung : storming
- Einschliessung : confinement
- Überfall : raid
- Vergebliche belagerung : unsuccessful siege
- Seeschlacht : naval battle 

These battle types are placed into 4 larger categories (see pp 602-607) with subcategories.

- "Land-schlachten, -Treffen, -Gefechte" ("land battles")
- "See-Schlachten, -Treffen, -Gefechte" ("sea battles")
- "Angriff, Erstürmung, Belagerung, Kapitulation befestigter Plätse" ("Attack, assault, siege, capitulation fortified places")
- "Kapitulation auf freiem Felde ("surrenders (not after a siege)")

There is also a category entitled "Summe der" (total of the ...)

- Kämpfe zu Lande ("battles on land")
- Kämpfe zur See ("battles at sea")
- Belagerungen ("siege")
- Kapitulation ("surrender")

Final total category "Gesamtsumme der Kämpfe" ("total fights")

- "die bedeutendsten niederlagen der Foo gegen die Bar" : "the most significant defeats of Foo against Bar"
- "die größten Siege der Foo gegen die Bar" : "the biggest victories of Foo against Bar"

Corrections

- Bodart listed the date of the Battle of Ringgold as 1863-11-13 to 1863-11-25; I changed this to 
  1863-11-23 to 1863-11-25, the correct dates for this battle.

Several "battles" in Bodart are campaigns.  For exmample, Petersburg
spans June 9, 1864 (First Battle of Petersburg) to April 3, 1865
(capture of Petersburg after the Third Battle of Petersburg). This
includes parts of the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign and Appomattox
Campaign. 

While most entries are presented in an almost tabular form, some
entries only have a paragraph of text.  An example of this is from
p. 528, Schlacht bei Perryville,

 Sieg der Konföderierten (68.000 M.) unter Gen. Bragg über die Unierten
 (54.000 M.) unter GM. Buell. 

The Google Books translation of this passage is 

 Victory for the Confederates (68,000 meters) under General. Bragg on the Uniate
 (54,000 meters) in GM. Buell."

The relevant data that I extract from this text is,

- Confederates are the victor
- Confederate force
  - gesamt-starke = 68000
  - commander = "Gen. Bragg"
- Union force
  - gesamt-starke = 54000
  - commander "GM. Buell"

The sources cited by Bodart are (p. 29):

- Century Company "Battles and leaders of the civil war"
- Lee-Childe "Le general Lee, sa vie er ses campagnes"
- Official Records of the Union and Confederate armies
