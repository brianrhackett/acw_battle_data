Bodart (1908) data on force sizes and casualties in battles of the American Civil War

These data are from Bodart (1908), "Milit√§r-Historisches Kreigs-Lexicon (1618-1905)".
See :doc:`bodart1908_battles` for more information on this source.

This table contains force sizes and casualties for each combatant in
each battle.

I have found that the strength values in Bodart tend to be higher in
other sources. He seems to use the total size of the unit involved in
that theater or operations, without considering which parts of that
unit participated in a given battle.
