Battle data for the battles of the American Civil War in Clodfelter, M. (2008) *Warfare And Armed Conflicts: A Statistical
Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1494-2007*.

Clodfelter has no strict rule for the inclusion of battles; his criteria is to include "all important and significant actions and the results of each conflict" (p. 1).
No casualty threshhold is used to select battles because that would have to vary across wars to produce sensical results.

Clodfelter divides the American Civil War into three theaters

- Eastern
- Western
- Blockade War

and divides the battles into thirteen groups: East (1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865), West (1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865), and Blocade War (1861--1862, 1863, 1864--1865).

Note on battle casualty percent. 15 percent for the American Civil War (p. 5).

The following battles had a significant naval component.

-  Roanoke Island (Feb 7-8, 1862): large land component (13000, 3000)
-  Hampton Roads (Mar 8, 1862): ship vs. ship.
-  New Orleans (April 24, 1862): ship vs. fort.
-  Galveston (Jan 1, 1863) Both sides had some land forces.
-  Fort Hindman (Jan 11, 1863). Both sides had significant land forces.
-  Mobile Bay (Aug 5, 1864): Mostly ships.
-  Fort Fisher (Jan 13-15). Both sides had significant land forces.
   Bombardment + assault on fort.
