study_area
----------

:title: Study Area
:type: number
:format: default


Study area in acres
The Study Area represents the historic extent of the battle as it unfolded across the landscape. The Study Area contains resources known to relate to or contribute to the battle event: where troops maneuvered and deployed, immediately before and after combat, and where they fought during combat. Historic accounts, terrain analysis, and feature identification inform the delineation of the Study Area boundary.  Historic setting, approaches, and natural features that figure importantly in the battle are defining elements. The Study Area indicates the extent to which historic and archeological resources associated with the battle (areas of combat, command, communications, logistics, medical services, etc.) may be found and protected. Surveyors delineated Study Area boundaries for every battle site that was positively identified through research and field survey, regardless of its present integrity.


       
core_area
---------

:title: core_area
:type: number
:format: default


Core area in acres
The Core Area represents the areas of direct engagement on the battlefield. Positions that delivered or received fire, and the space connecting them, fall within the Core Area.  Frequently described as “hallowed ground,” land within the Core Area is often the first to be targeted for protection. There may be more than one Core Area on a battlefield, but all lie within the Study Area.


       
potnr_boundary
--------------

:title: potnr_boundary
:type: number
:format: default


Potential National Register Boundary area in acres
Unlike the Study and Core Area, which are based only upon the interpretation of historic events, the Potential National Register (PotNR) boundary represents ABPP’s assessment of a Study Area’s current integrity (the surviving landscape and features that convey the site’s historic sense of place). The PotNR boundary may include all or some of the Study Area, and all or some of the Core Area. Although preparing a National Register nomination may require further assessment of historic integrity and more documentation than that provided by the ABPP survey, PotNR boundaries identify land that merits this additional effort.


       
strength_mean
-------------

:title: Strength (mean)
:type: number
:format: default
:constraints:
    :minimum: 0
    

Mean of the estimated strength in personnel of the force. See code for how it is calculated.

strength_var
------------

:title: Strength (variance)
:type: number
:format: default
:constraints:
    :minimum: 0
    

Variance of the estimated strength in personnel of the force. See code for how it is calculated.
