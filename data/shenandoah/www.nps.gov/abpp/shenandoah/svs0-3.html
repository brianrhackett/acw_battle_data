<H1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H1><p>
<p>
This study of Civil War sites in the Virginia part of the<p>
Shenandoah Valley was authorized by Public Law 101-628.  It<p>
accomplishes the following tasks:<p>
<p>
<ul><p>
<li> Identifies significant Civil War sites;<p>
<li> Establishes their relative importance;<p>
<li> Determines their condition;<p>
<li> Assesses threats to their integrity;<p>
<li> Provides alternatives for their preservation and <br>  
interpretation by Federal, State and local governments or by<br>
other public or private entities.<p>
</ul><p>
The time and funds available dictated a need to focus the
study<p>
on major battlefields as the kind of historic sites under the<p>
greatest preservation pressures.  While the Civil War
certainly<p>
did not play out exclusively on battlefields, the latter are<p>
among the most dramatic sites conveying a very high level of<p>
meaning to Americans and are extremely vulnerable to
development<p>
and visual intrusion.  Action to preserve and interpret key<p>
battlefields can provide the conceptual structure around which
to<p>
evaluate and preserve other sites, buildings, and structures<p>
significant to preserving a record of the Civil War in the<p>
Valley.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs2-1.html"><B>1. Significant Sites</B></a><p>
<p>
The study examined battlefields in eight Virginia counties: <p>
Augusta, Clarke, Frederick, Highland, Page, Rockingham,<p>
Shenandoah, and Warren.  Official war records document 326
armed<p>
conflict incidents in the Shenandoah Valley and this does not<p>
include many of the raids, ambushes, and partisan actions.  As
a<p>
result of historical analysis, the 326 notable armed conflicts<p>
were reduced to fifteen battle events of major significance. 
The<p>
battlefields selected for study were associated with Stonewall<p>
Jackson's Valley Campaign of 1862, the Gettysburg Campaign of<p>
1863, and the decisive Lynchburg-Early-Sheridan Campaigns of<p>
1864.  These three campaigns, encompassing the fifteen
individual<p>
sites, are the most significant events in the Valley's Civil
War<p>
history.<p>
<p>
The sites associated with these campaigns were: (1862) Cross<p>
Keys, Front Royal, First Kernstown, McDowell, Port Republic,<p>
First Winchester; (1863) Second Winchester; (1864) Cedar
Creek,<p>
Cool Spring, Fisher's Hill, Second Kernstown, New Market,<p>
Opequon, Piedmont, and Tom's Brook.<p>
<p>
The analysis of <a href="svs2-4.html">military campaigns</a>
as<p>
the historic context for the major battlefields in the Valley<p>
indicates that the 1862 and 1864 campaigns are of higher<p>
importance, although for different reasons, than the local
events<p>
associated with the 1863 Gettysburg campaign.  From the field<p>
survey and historical research, it further appears that both
the<p>
1862 Jackson campaign and the 1864 Lynchburg-Early-Sheridan<p>
campaigns, as represented by their fourteen associated sites,<p>
meet National Historic Landmark (NHL) criteria.  Cedar Creek<p>
already is designated a National Historic Landmark, and
Opequon<p>
may also individually meet NHL criteria.  The other sites<p>
probably would not meet NHL criteria on their own (a key
factor<p>
in considering potential additions to the National Park
System),<p>
although they appear to qualify for the National Register of<p>
Historic Places.  There is no clear line of historical
argument<p>
that assures a credible relative ranking of individual<p>
battlefields based on significance other than for Cedar Creek
and<p>
Opequon; however, both of these latter sites represent the
same<p>
campaign with neither telling the whole story of its campaign.<p>
<p>
As a result of field survey and research into the records of<p>
battle events, each site was documented as a study area, the<p>
entire area of activity involved in the battle event; and its<p>
incorporated core area, the area of principal armed conflict
and<p>
other closely related activity such as command and control<p>
locations.<p>
<p>
Taken together, the fifteen battlefield study areas in the
Valley<p>
comprised 85,909 acres.  The average size of the study areas
was<p>
5,727 acres and they ranged from 3,082 acres at Front Royal to<p>
22,274 acres at Second Winchester.  Battlefield core areas<p>
totaled 33,844 acres, with an average size of 2,415 acres. 
Core<p>
areas ranged from 944 acres at Front Royal to 6,252 acres at<p>
Cedar Creek.  A table is enclosed with this Executive Summary<p>
listing all battlefields and their associated campaign
context,<p>
their size, condition, and preservation risk.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs4-1.html"><B>2. Condition And Threats To<p>
Integrity</B></a><p>
<p>
Integrity tells the current condition of the battlefield core<p>
area, and threats tell what to anticipate in the foreseeable<p>
future.  Of the 85,909 acres of battlefield study areas 82%
were<p>
determined to have generally good integrity.  The primary
losses<p>
of integrity have occurred in the lower (northern) Valley in
the<p>
vicinity of the cities of Winchester and Front Royal.  The<p>
battlefields of McDowell, Piedmont, Port Republic, Cross Keys,<p>
Cool Spring, Cedar Creek, Fisher's Hill, First Kernstown and<p>
Tom's Brook were all found to be in fair to good condition. 
The<p>
battlefields of Second Kernstown and New Market were in poor
to<p>
fair condition, Opequon and Front Royal were in poor
condition,<p>
and First Winchester has been lost as a coherent battlefield<p>
site.<p>
<p>
Threats to preservation of the fifteen battlefields under
study<p>
come primarily from residential construction (threatening 12<p>
sites), commercial development (threatening 7), highway<p>
construction (threatening 6) and industrial development<p>
(threatening 3 sites).  Taken together, integrity and threats<p>
identify categories of risk to preservation.  The following
list<p>
of battlefield sites is the nearest approximation to a listing
of<p>
current relative risk priority that is possible based on both<p>
historical and descriptive site analysis (1 is highest risk,
15<p>
is lowest risk).<p>

<p>
<a href="svs4-3.html"><B>3.  Relative Significance</B></a><p>
<p>
This listing of sites based on the current risk to
preservation<p>
leaves unanswered the public policy question of whether it is<p>
better to focus preservation efforts on sites nearly lost, or
on<p>
sites where pristine historic landscapes remain well-preserved<p>
and the Civil War setting is evoked easily.  There are
arguments<p>
to be made for either approach but the question itself cannot
be<p>
answered further through historical analysis.  There are<p>
basically three choices that can be made.<p>
<p>
A.  The lowest risk, good condition sites often lend
themselves<p>
to a high degree of protection and preservation with minimum<p>
costs and least disruption of local people while resulting in<p>
retention of exceptional quality historical sites.  Sites in
this<p>
category are Cross Keys (1862), Port Republic (1862), Piedmont<p>
(1864), and McDowell (1862).<p>
<p>
B.  The higher risk, poor condition sites generally would
require<p>
higher costs and often more difficult resolution of competing<p>
interests.  However, these sites represent historic events of<p>
great importance too, and if action is not taken imminently,<p>
there will not even be fragments remaining to commemorate the<p>
former existence of these battle locations.  Sites in this<p>
category are Opequon (1864), First Winchester (1862), and Front
Royal (1862).<p>
<p>
C.  There also are good reasons to choose sites under<p>
intermediate levels of risk as the primary preservation focus.
<p>
For example, sites that are in good to fair condition but
under<p>
moderate levels of threat; or, sites that are in poor to fair<p>
condition experiencing yet greater levels of threat.  The<p>
rationale here is that good condition, low threat sites might<p>
survive longer without intervention, and that worthwhile<p>
preservation results can no longer be obtained from lost or
poor<p>
condition sites under extreme threats given the extreme<p>
confrontational and other costs, while sites in the
intermediate<p>
risk categories represent problems that still are manageable. <p>
Sites in the relatively LESS risky intermediate group are Cool<p>
Spring (1864), Fisher's Hill (1864), and Cedar Creek (1864). <p>
Sites in the relatively MORE risky intermediate group are<p>
First/Second Kernstown (1862/64), New Market (1864), Tom's
Brook<p>
(1864), and Second Winchester (1863).<p>
<p>
<a href="svs6-1.html"><B>4.  Preservation Alternatives</B></a><p>
<p>
Current information indicates that the Valley's population
will<p>
grow by 18%, or by 63,150 people, over the next 30 years. 
Much<p>
of this growth will be in and around the cities of Winchester,<p>
Front Royal, and Harrisonburg.  Associated with this growth
will<p>
be the four principal sources of changing land use that will<p>
damage or destroy key historic sites:  residential,
commercial,<p>
highway, and industrial development.<p>
<p>
One key to preserving Civil War sites is to assure that local<p>
governments have available to them information on the location<p>
and significance of such sites so that they are able to use
their<p>
planning, zoning, and other powers to channel economic<p>
development in ways and places that do not bring harm to<p>
important resources.  This report and its supporting data
begins<p>
to serve that purpose.<p>
<p>
Moreover, Civil War and other historic resources are a key
part<p>
of the Valley's resource base for a <a
href="svs5.html">heritage<p>
tourism</a> component of economic development.  The study<p>
determined the general prospects for heritage tourism in the<p>
Valley are broadly positive, although there should be targeted<p>
market research as part of designing a specific battlefield<p>
protection and interpretation program in the Valley that would
be<p>
structured to avoid undue intrusion on private property owners<p>
and retention of the rural Valley way of life.  Nevertheless,<p>
protection of these fifteen major Civil War  battlefield sites<p>
can be seen as not only an important national objective, but
also<p>
as an important element of the local economy and, therefore,
an<p>
added incentive to local governments to play a substantial
role<p>
in protecting these sites.<p>
<p>
Five approaches are available for protecting some or all of
the<p>
fifteen major Civil War battlefields in the Virginia part of
the<p>
Valley.  Generally these actions would apply to core areas and<p>
selected parts of study areas of each site.  A summary of the<p>
specific preservation potential at each site is given in Part<p>
Four of the main report.  The alternative preservation
approaches<p>
are the following:<p>
<p>
1.  No focused action but continue to let private and
local<p>
government actions occur as they are now.<p>
<p>
2.  Enhanced public funding and technical assistance to
State<p>
and local governments and to private owners for site
preservation<p>
and interpretation.<p>
<p>
3.  Create one or more affiliated areas of the National
Park<p>
System.<p>
<p>
4.  Acquire one or two sites for the National Park System
as<p>
interpretive, technical assistance, and management focal
points<p>
in conjunction with other battlefields under non-federal<p>
management.<p>
<p>
5.  Acquire selected parts of all fifteen significant<p>
battlefields for the National Park System.<p>

<p>
Since the fifteen battlefields vary considerably in ownership,<p>
land use, integrity and threats, no single alternative is best<p>
suited to these sites.  A balance must be achieved between<p>
preservation, the Valley lifestyle, and economic development;<p>
this suggests a regional approach and flexibility in how each<p>
site is treated.  While alternatives 1 and 5, above, do not
seem<p>
feasible or desirable, some combinations of 2, 3, and 4 would
be<p>
appropriate if developed through a regional mechanism<p>
emphasizing: (a) stewardship through continued private
ownership<p>
when current land use practices are compatible with
battlefield<p>
preservation and interpretation; and (b) wide participation of<p>
local governments and property owners together with State and<p>
Federal agencies.<p>
<p>
The Virginia Shenandoah Valley is the locale for tangible
remains<p>
of some of the nation's major historic resources.  Effective<p>
retention of most of these remains is an opportunity that
still<p>
is available but one that must be handled by governments and
the<p>
community working together in order to be successful, for this<p>
opportunity will only remain for a relatively short time.
