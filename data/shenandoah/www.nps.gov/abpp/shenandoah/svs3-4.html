<B>Forces Engaged:</B> [c] Jackson's division of three brigades
(Winder, Campbell, Taliaferro) and Ewell's division of four
brigades (Taylor, Trimble, Elzey, Scott), three regiments of

6,500.<p>

(62k/243w/1,714m&c)<p>
<p>
<B>Significance:</B> First Winchester was a major victory in
General Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign.  On the tactical level,
the battle displays considerable finesse, particularly on the
part of Ewell's division on the Front Royal Pike.  Brig. Gen.
Taylor's attack on Bower's Hill is considered a model brigade
maneuver by military historians.  The ultimate significance of
Jackson's victory at Winchester was its strategic impact.  Union
plans for a convergence on Richmond were disrupted by Jackson's
audacity, and thousands of Union reinforcements were diverted to
the Valley and the defense of Washington.<p>
<p><p><hr>
<p><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Prelude:</B> May 24, 1862, was a disastrous day for Maj. Gen.
Nathaniel Banks.  Learning that the Confederates had taken Front
Royal and were closing on Winchester, Banks ordered a hasty
retreat down the Valley Pike from Strasburg.  His columns were
attacked at Middletown and again at Newtown (Stephens City) by
the converging forces of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson.  The
Confederates took many US prisoners and captured so many wagons
and stores that they later nicknamed the Union general
``Commissary Banks.'' Jackson pressed the pursuit for most of the
night and allowed his exhausted soldiers but a few hours sleep
before dawn.
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  US Deployment at Winchester:</B> Banks now
deployed at Winchester to slow the CS pursuit.  He had two
brigades of infantry under Donelly and Gordon, a mixed brigade of
cavalry under Hatch, and 16 guns.  Gordon's brigade was placed on
the US right on Bower's Hill with its left flank at the Valley
Pike, supported by a battery of artillery.  The center of the
line (Camp Hill) was held by the cavalry supported by two guns. 
Donelly's brigade was placed in a crescent on the left to cover
the Front Royal and Millwood roads with the rest of the
artillery.  At earliest light the CS skirmish line advanced in
force driving the US pickets back to their main line of battle.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  CS Advance on Front Royal Pike:</B> During the
night, the advance of Maj. Gen. Richard Ewell's division (four
brigades) reached Buffalo Lick.  At dawn, he deployed his
brigades astride the Front Royal Pike and advanced against the
Union left flank.  His leading regiments (in particular the 21st
North Carolina) came under heavy fire from US forces deployed
behind stone fences and were repulsed.  CS forces regrouped and
brought up artillery.  After about an hour, they again advanced,
this time sending regiments to either side of the high ground to
enfilade the Union position.  Donelly (US) withdrew his brigade
to a position closer to town with his right flank anchored on
Camp Hill.  Trimble's brigade (CS) then attempted a flanking
movement to the right beyond the Millwood Road.  This movement
threatened the US left and rear.  This movement, in conjunction
with Confederate maneuvers on the left beyond the Valley Pike,
caused the Union line to collapse in this sector.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  CS Advance on Valley Pike:</B> In conjunction
with Ewell's advance on the Front Royal Pike, Jackson advanced
the Stonewall Brigade on the Valley Pike at early dawn in a heavy
fog.  At Jackson's command, the brigade swept over a hill to the
left of the pike, driving off the US skirmishers who held it. 
Jackson quickly placed a section of artillery on the hill to
engage US artillery on Bower's Hill at a range of less than half
a mile.  Union sharpshooters along Abrams Creek began picking off
the cannoneers.  In response, Banks moved his artillery farther
to the right to enfilade the CS artillery and heavily reinforced
his right flank with infantry.  Jackson brought up the rest of
his artillery and a duel ensued with the Union guns on Bower's
Hill.  It now appeared that the Union forces were preparing to
turn the Confederate left.
<p><p>
To counter this threat, Jackson deployed Taylor's Louisiana
brigade, reinforced by two regiments of Taliaferro's, to the left
along Abrams Creek.  Taylor marched under fire to a position
overlapping the Union right and then attacked Bower's Hill.  The
Confederate assault swept irresistibly forward over the crest in
the face of determined resistance.  The Union right flank
collapsed, even as the left flank was being pressured by Ewell. 
Union soldiers began streaming back into town.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  US Retreat:</B> With the collapse of both flanks,
Union forces retreated through the streets of Winchester and
north on the Valley Pike.  Confederate pursuit was lethargic, as
the troops were exhausted from the non-stop marching of the
previous week.  Nevertheless, many Union prisoners fell into
Confederate hands.  Ashby's cavalry was disorganized from the
actions of 24 May and did not pursue until Banks had already
reached the Potomac River.

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The battlefield of First Winchester has been lost as a coherent
landscape to the growth of the city of Winchester.  Most of the
core area has been developed for residences on Bower's Hill,
along US 11, and around the intersection of I-81 and rte. 50. US
Artillery positions have been built upon and vantage points lost.

According to a county planning official 1,600 new residences have
been approved for construction at the base of Bower's Hill along
Abrams Creek.  Access to Battery Hill (Hill 819) north of Cedar
Creek Grade, west of US 11 and south of railroad tracks, would
offer an interesting vantage point, although access is
restricted.  This site overlooks the field over which Taylor's
Louisiana brigade marched to assault Bower's Hill, just south of
the water tower.  This same ground was fought over during the
first day's fighting at Second Winchester when this hill served
as a CS artillery position.
<p><p>
Willow Lawn, circa 1765, is set back from the road behind an
industrial building, west of US 11 and north of the railroad. 
Parkins Mill on US 11 at Abrams Creek (burned in 1864 and rebuilt
after the war).  All historic structures are surrounded by modern
buildings.  The Winchester Historic District protects many
buildings of Civil War vintage and offers a focal point for
visitors.  Beck and Grunder's ``Three Battles of Winchester''
provides a driving tour of the battlefield with stops at Camp
Hill, Milltown, Williamsburg Heights, and Bower's Hill.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The core area of the First Winchester battlefield has largely
been lost and, according to a county planning official, 1600
additional houses are planned for this area in the immediate
future.  This will eliminate the remaining core area of First
Winchester and decrease the size of the remaining core area of
Second Winchester.
