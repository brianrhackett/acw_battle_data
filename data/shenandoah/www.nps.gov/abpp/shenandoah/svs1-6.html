<H2>6. Archeological Resources and Battlefield Burials </H2>
<p>
A second important class of battlefield resources is
archeological.  Many battlefields, large and small, possess
artifacts, soil strata, structural remains, or other features and
combinations of features that enable archeologists to recover
information on important historical questions.  Patterns of
military debris have been used at some sites to corroborate or
amplify known information on the location and movements of
individual units.  Shell fragments can be used to identify the
types of artillery engaged.  A cluster of friction primer fuses
can indicate the position of a single cannon and even suggest the
number of rounds fired.  Clusters of spent or dropped bullets can
identify the locations of battle lines.  A rifleman, for example,
could easily fire his standard supply of sixty rounds of
ammunition in an hour.  This amounts to about four pounds of
lead.  A brigade of 2,400 riflemen could deliver 4.8 tons per
hour.  Although a battle may have lasted only a few hours,
experience has shown that significant archeological evidence
remains in the ground, even if it has been farmed for the
intervening 125 years.  The thriving relic-hunting community can
certainly attest to this fact.  Despite a seeming abundance of
remains, however, the archeological record of a battlefield, over
time, can be seriously depleted by relic hunting.
<p>
<p>
Human remains are also an important part of the archeological
record.
<p>
<p>
Many people feel that battlefields are hallowed ground, a
sentiment expressed in President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
We are met here on a great battlefield of that war.  We have come
to dedicate a portion of it as a final resting place for those
who here gave their lives that that nation might live.  It is
altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But in a
larger sense we can not dedicate--we can not consecrate--we can
not hallow this ground.  The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor will to
add or detract.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
More than 3,600 soldiers perished on the fifteen battlefields
studied, not including those who later died of their wounds.  The
dead were typically buried hastily, and many graves were poorly
marked making later reinterment difficult.  In 1865 and 1866,
local residents were paid to disinter remains and bring them to
the national cemeteries established for that purpose.  Many
bodies were found and removed to cemeteries at this time.  Often,
however, only portions of the remains were reinterred. 
Authorities paid for skulls and long bones, and other parts of
the skeleton sometimes remained in the ground.  Archeologists
have uncovered Civil War burial pits on other battlefields where
only the skulls were removed.
<p>
<p>
During the field survey, local residents related several
anecdotes pertaining to accidentally unearthed burials at
Piedmont, Fisher's Hill, and Cool Spring.  No evidence was
offered to corroborate these accounts (respondents were
protecting their sources), but such remains have been
occasionally unearthed elsewhere.  Finding the remains of a
soldier who was buried where he fell, or near a hospital or
encampment site, would not be that unusual.  Discovered bones
have been ``dropped off'' occasionally at battlefield parks, by
those who wished to see the bodies receive proper burial.   In
1988, for example, relic hunters unearthed the remains of four
members of the Irish Brigade on private property adjacent to
Antietam National Battlefield Park.  The soldiers were later
reinterred in the National Cemetery with full military honors. 
Stories are related in the relic-hunting community of bones
discovered in the wake of bulldozers at development sites at
Chantilly and Centreville, Virginia.  In 1989, the remains of a
Louisiana artilleryman were discovered at Brandy Station during
an archeological survey.  
<p>
<p>
It is reasonable to assume that some burials are scattered over
the fifteen battlefields studied, but the number cannot be
estimated.  Often the survival of such remains is dependent upon
the acidity of the soil.  If the acidity is high, bones can be
almost totally dissolved, although buttons, belt buckles, or
other evidence will survive.  Although it would be incorrect to
view these battlefields as vast cemeteries, it is probable that
an unknown number of burials remain undiscovered at many of these
sites. 
<p>
<p>
The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Reserve Officers Association,
and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, among others, have
expressed the opinion that the remains of Civil War veterans
should be reburied in a national cemetery and accorded full
military honors.  In general, this is the policy followed when
accidental disinterments are brought to the attention of
authorities.  Under Virginia law a permit is required for the
archeological removal of human remains or associated artifacts
from any unmarked human burial site on state, local, or privately
owned land.
