<p>
<B>Significance:</B> The battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic
were the decisive victories of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. ``Stonewall''
Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign.  At Cross Keys, one of Jackson's
divisions beat back the army of Maj. Gen. John C. Fr‚mont
approaching from Harrisonburg, while elements of a second
division held back the vanguard of Brig. Gen. James Shields'
division advancing toward Port Republic on the Luray Road. 
During the night of 8-9 June, Jackson withdrew from in front of
Fr‚mont and at dawn attacked two of Shields's four brigades
(commanded by Brig. Gen. E. B. Tyler), precipitating the battle
of Port Republic.  Fr‚mont reached the vicinity too late to aid
Tyler, who was badly beaten.  With the retreat of both US armies,
Jackson was freed to join the CS army commanded by General Robert
E. Lee in the Seven Days' Battles against McClellan's army before
Richmond.<p>
<p>
In addition to its importance in Jackson's overall strategy of
defeating two separated armies in detail, Cross Keys provides
interesting lessons at the tactical level.  By deft maneuver and
clever use of the terrain, Confederate Brig. Gen. Isaac Trimble
shattered a larger US force and stalled Fr‚mont's attack.  The
ground where this tactical action occurred is pristine and
enables understanding of this phase of the conflict.
<p><p><hr><p><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Prelude:</B> The hamlet of Port Republic lies on a neck of
land between the North and South rivers at the point where they
conjoin.  On 6-7 June 1862, the army of Maj. Gen. Thomas J.
Jackson, numbering about 16,000, bivouacked north of Port
Republic, Ewell's division along the banks of Mill Creek near
Goods Mill, and Winder's division on the north bank of North
River near the bridge.  One regiment (15AL) was left to block the
roads at Union Church.  Jackson's headquarters were in Madison
Hall, the home of Dr. Kemper, at Port Republic.  The army trains
were parked nearby.
<p><p>
Two US columns converged on Jackson's position.  The army of Maj.
Gen. John C. Fr‚mont, about 15,000 strong, moved south on the
Valley Pike and reached the vicinity of Harrisonburg on 6 June. 
The division of General Shields, about 10,000 strong, advanced
south from Front Royal in the Luray (Page) Valley, but was badly
strung out because of the muddy Luray Road.  At Port Republic,
Jackson possessed the last intact bridge on the North River and
the fords on the South River by which Fr‚mont and Shields could
unite.  Jackson determined to check Fr‚mont's advance at Mill
Creek, while meeting Shields on the east bank of the North Fork. 
A CS signal station on Massanutten monitored US progress.
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  Skirmishing at Cross Keys Tavern:</B> Late in the
day on 7 June, Fr‚mont's advance guard encountered Jackson's
pickets near Cross Keys Tavern.  A few shots were fired and the
US cavalry fell back onto their main body, which was approaching.
Darkness prevented further developments.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  Surprise Raid on Port Republic:</B> Colonel Samuel
Carroll at the head of a regiment of cavalry, supported by a
battery and a brigade of infantry, was sent ahead by Shields to
secure the North River Bridge at Port Republic.  Shortly after
dawn (8 June), Carroll scattered the CS pickets, forded the South
River, and dashed into Port Republic.  Jackson and his staff
raced down the main street from headquarters and across the
bridge, narrowly eluding capture (two members of his staff were
captured).  Carroll deployed one gun aimed at the bridge and
brought up another.  Jackson directed the defense, ordering
Poague's battery to unlimber on the north bank.  Carrington
brought up a gun from the vicinity of Madison Hall to rake the
Main St.  The 37VA Infantry charged across the bridge to drive
the US cavalry out of the town.  Carroll retreated in confusion,
losing his two guns, before his infantry could come within range.

Three CS batteries unlimbered on the bluffs east of Port Republic
on the north bank of the South Fork and fired on the retreating
Federals.  Carroll retired several miles north on the Luray Road.
Jackson stationed Taliaferro's brigade in Port Republic and
positioned the Stonewall Brigade near Bogota with the artillery
to prevent any further surprises.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  US Deployment:</B> Meanwhile, Fr‚mont, with
Cluseret's brigade in the lead, renewed his advance from the
vicinity of Harrisonburg.  After driving away the CS skirmishers,
Cluseret reached and deployed his right flank along the
Keezletown Road near Union Church.  One by one, the US brigades
came into line: Schenck on Cluseret's right, Milroy on his left,
and Stahel on the far left, his left flank near Congers Creek. 
Bohlen's and Koltes' brigades were held in reserve near the
center of the line.  A regiment of US cavalry moved south on the
road to secure the right flank.  Batteries were brought to the
front.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  CS Deployment:</B> Gen. Richard Ewell deployed
his infantry division (CS) behind Mill Creek, Trimble's brigade
on the right across the Port Republic Road, Elzey's in the center
along the high bluffs.  Ewell concentrated his artillery (4
batteries) at the center of the line.  As US troops deployed
along Keezletown Road, Trimble advanced his brigade a quarter of
a mile to Victory Hill and deployed Courtenay's (Latimer's)
battery on a hill to his left supported by the 21NC Regiment. 
The 15AL, which had been skirmishing near Union Church, rejoined
the brigade.  Trimble held his regiments out of sight behind the
crest of the hill.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.  US Attack and Repulse:</B> Fr‚mont determined to
advance his battle line with the evident intention of developing
the CS position, assumed to be behind Mill Creek.  This maneuver
required an elaborate right wheel.  Stahel's brigade on the far
left had the farthest distance to cover and advanced first. 
Milroy moved forward on Stahel's right and rear.  US batteries
were advanced with infantry lines south of Keezletown Road and
engaged CS batteries.  Stahel appeared oblivious to Trimble's
advanced position.  His battle line passed down into the valley,
crossed the run, and began climbing Victory Hill.  At a distance
of ``sixty paces,'' Trimble's infantry stood up and delivered a
devastating volley.  Stahel's brigade recoiled in confusion with
heavy casualties.  The Union brigade regrouped on the height
opposite Victory Hill but made no effort to renew their assault.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Six.  Trimble's Flanking Attacks:</B> Stahel did not
renew his attack but brought up a battery (Buell's) to support
his position.  Trimble moved the 15AL by the right flank and up a
ravine to get on the battery's left.  In the meantime, Ewell sent
two regiments (13VA and 25VA) along the ridge to Trimble's right,
attracting a severe fire from the US battery.  With a shout, the
15AL emerged from their ravine and began to climb the hill toward
the battery, precipitating a mel‚e.  Trimble advanced his other
two regiments (16MS on left and 21GA on right) from their
position on Victory Hill, forcing back the US line.  The US
battery limbered hastily and withdrew, saving its guns.  A US
regiment counter-attacked briefly striking the left flank of the
16MS but was forced back in desperate fighting.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Seven.  US Withdrawal to Keezletown Road:</B> Trimble
continued advancing up the ravine on the CS right, outflanking
successive US positions.  In the meantime, Milroy advanced on
Stahel's right supported by artillery.  Milroy's line came within
rifle-musket range of the CS center behind Mill Creek and opened
fire.  US batteries continued to engage CS batteries in an
artillery duel.  Bohlen advanced on the far US left to stiffen
Stahel's crumbling defense.  Milroy's left flank was endangered
by Stahel's retreat, and Fr‚mont ordered him to withdraw. 
Jackson brought Taylor's brigade forward to support Ewell if
needed, but Taylor remained in reserve on the Port Republic Road
near the Dunker Church.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Eight.  US Attacks on the Right:</B> Seemingly paralyzed
by the decimation of Stahel's brigade on his left, Fr‚mont was
unable to mount a coordinated attack.  He ordered Schenck's
brigade forward to find the CS left flank south of Union Church. 
Ewell reinforced his left with elements of Elzey's brigade. 
Severe firing erupted along the line but quickly died down.  CS
brigadiers Elzey and Steuart were wounded in this exchange. 
Fr‚mont withdrew his force to Keezletown Road, placing his
artillery on the heights to his rear (Oak Ridge).  Artillery
firing continued.  At dusk, Trimble pushed his battle line
forward to within a quarter mile of the US position, anticipating
a night assault.  CS accounts describe the US soldiers going into
camp, lighting fires and making coffee.  Ewell ordered Trimble to
withdraw without making the attack.

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The battlefield of Cross Keys is largely intact, and the
landscape retains a marked similarity to its Civil War-era
appearance.  Land use is primarily agricultural with some
residential housing along the main roads.  New houses on large
lots have been built along the CS defensive line behind Mill
(Black Anchor) Creek.  Several historic structures in the
vicinity remain: the Union Church (Ruritan Hall) and cemetery, an
antebellum house adjacent to the cemetery, and the old Cross Keys
Tavern behind the farm bureau co-op, an old house across from the
farm bureau, and the Widow Haugh House adjacent to Lee-Jackson
parcel.  The Widow Haugh House resident points out repaired
damage to the roof and interior walls of the house caused by a US
solid shot.
<p><p>
The Lee-Jackson Foundation owns 100 acres on Victory Hill, scene
of Trimble's maneuvers and some of the most severe fighting.  The
road network appears to have been altered somewhat but historic
maps are not accurate enough to allow reconstruction.  The
landscape is very hilly and cut with deep ravines making further
assessment of small-scale features difficult without gaining
access to perhaps a dozen private farms.
<p><p>
The town of Port Republic is listed in the National Register as a
historic district.  The UDC has erected a small monument near the
intersection of rtes. 679 and 659. Circle Tour markers were
erected along rte. 276 south of rte. 659.  One small section of
the original road bed of the Port Republic Road may be seen just
south of Victory Hill School along rte. 659. Several old
structures remain in the hamlet of Goods Mill, which played a
peripheral role in the battle.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Developmental pressures from the vicinity of Harrisonburg have
spread south into the vicinity of Cross Keys in recent years,
although the study area has not yet been impacted.  Several large
parcels of land are or will soon be for sale.  Although the
market is currently soft (1991), there is some fear, according to
a local landowner, that these tracts will be bought by developers
and subdivided.  A county planning official stated that the
dramatic growth of the City of Harrisonburg during the 1980s has
slowed, thus easing developmental pressures south of the city. 
The growth rate for the City of Harrisonburg is expected to
stabilize for the 1990s. Several very large poultry sheds have
been built in the immediate vicinity, and although these are not
technically ``permanent,'' they can quickly overwhelm a viewshed
if prominently placed.
