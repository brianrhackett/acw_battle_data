href="crook.gif">George Crook</a>
<B>Forces Engaged:</B> [c] Four infantry divisions (Gordon,
Rodes, Ramseur, and Breckinridge/Wharton), four brigades of
cavalry, and artillery, totalling about 13,000; [u] Three
infantry divisions (Thoburn, Duval, and Mulligan), two cavalry
divisions (Averell and Duffi‚), and three batteries of artillery,
numbering about 10,000.
<B>Casualties:</B> [c] unreported, est. 600 (100k/500w); [u]
about 1,200 (120k/600w/480m&c).
<p><p>
<B>Significance:</B> In late June and early July 1864, Lt. Gen.
Jubal A. Early's Confederate army used the strategic Shenandoah
Valley corridor to terrorize Maryland, defeat a Union army at
Monocacy, and march on Washington, D.C.  Only the diversion of
reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac, bogged down in the
trenches before Petersburg, turned back the invasion.  Early
returned to the Valley and achieved a decisive victory over
George Crook's command at Second Kernstown on 24 July.  He
subsequently sent cavalry to burn Chambersburg, Pennsylvania on
30 July.  These disasters forced Lt. Gen. U.S. Grant to take
immediate action to solve the Valley problem.  The VI Corps and
elements of the XIX Corps were returned to the Valley and united
with Crook's corps (called the Army of West Virginia). 
Additional cavalry units were diverted to the Valley.  More
importantly, Grant unified the various military districts of the
region into the Middle Military District and appointed Maj. Gen.
Philip Sheridan as overall commander.  Sheridan took command of
the newly christened Army of the Shenandoah on 7 August at
Harpers Ferry.  Sheridan's leadership and his strongly reinforced
army turned the tide against Confederate power in the Shenandoah
Valley.
<p><p>
Rutherford B. Hayes, later president of the United States,
commanded a brigade during the battle on the left of the US line.
John C. Breckinridge, former senator and vice president of the
United States, commanded the Confederate division that confronted
Hayes.

<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  Skirmishing at Kernstown (23 July):</B> On the
afternoon of 23 July 1864, CS cavalry advanced aggressively down
the Valley Pike, driving US cavalry from Newtown (Stephens City)
to Kernstown.  Brig. Gen. George Crook directed Duval's infantry
division to deploy across the pike and clear the town of
Confederates, which they did with little difficulty.  Crook then
withdrew his infantry to Winchester behind Abrams Creek, leaving
a brigade of cavalry to picket Kernstown.  The CS army encamped
in the vicinity of Strasburg with headquarters at the Kendricks'
House: Ramseur at Capon Grade, Rodes at Fisher's Mill, Wharton
and Gordon on Hupp's Hill.  The CS cavalry withdrew to the
vicinity of Newtown. 
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  Advance of CS Infantry (24 July):</B> At first
light, the CS infantry left their encampments near Strasburg and
advanced down the Valley Pike.  At Bartonsville, Ramseur's
division was directed west on side roads to the Middle Road. 
Gordon, Wharton, and Rodes continued ahead on the pike.  Early
sent two columns of cavalry to the east and west on a wide-
ranging maneuver to converge on Winchester and the Federal rear. 
Cavalry led the advance down the pike, coming up against the main
US force at Kernstown about 1000 hours.  About noon, the vanguard
of the CS infantry reached Kernstown.  Gordon deployed to the
left of the Valley Pike, Wharton to the right.  Ramseur deployed
across the Middle Road at Mrs. Massie's house.  Rodes moved east
from the Pike, following a ravine.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  US Deployment on Pritchard's Hill:</B> Crook
received information that Early's army was approaching and
brought two of his three divisions into line just north of Hoge's
Run at Kernstown.  Mulligan's division held the US center behind
a stone fence at the Pritchard House, supported by Capt. Henry
DuPont's artillery massed on Pritchard's Hill to his rear. 
Duval's two brigades were separated and posted on Mulligan's
flanks with Hayes' brigade extending the US line east of the
Valley Pike.  A strong skirmish line was posted near Opequon
Church.  Thoburn's division was held in reserve on Pritchard's
Hill to the right rear of the main US line.  Cavalry protected
both flanks.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  CS Attack on Center:</B> About noon, Gordon's
division advanced in line west of the pike, driving back the
skirmishers and closing with the main US line in the vicinity of
Opequon Church.  Mulligan's division counterattacked, supported
by Hayes on his left and took possession of the churchyard. 
Soldiers sheltered there from the intense firing behind stone
fences and headstones in the cemetery.  Gordon regrouped and
again advanced, compelling Mulligan to fall back 250 yards to the
stone fence along Pritchard's Lane.  Gordon reached Opequon
Church but could make no further headway.  CS artillery was
brought up south of the church to engage US artillery on
Pritchard's Hill.  One of Wharton's brigades came into line on
Gordon's right.  Crook repositioned his forces.  Duval's right
flank brigade was moved west, astride Middle Road.  Thoburn's
division was brought forward to fill the gap between Mulligan and
Duval.  Elements of Duffi‚'s cavalry supported the right flank on
the Middle Road and picketed Cedar Creek Grade to the west.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Five.  CS Attack on Left:</b> Ramseur's division came
into line from the Middle Road on Gordon's left and advanced. 
Gordon shifted a brigade to the open ground west of Opequon
Church and advanced against Thoburn in conjunction with Ramseur. 
Without orders Gordon's brigade attacked and dislodged US troops
sheltering behind two stone fences.  Thoburn withdrew to the base
of Pritchard's Hill, bending his line back to the north and
exposing Mulligan's right flank.  Ramseur advanced in force,
wheeling right to confront Thoburn's line and bringing a heavy
enfilade fire against Mulligan's line.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Six.  CS Attack on Right:</b> Wharton's division moved
along the ridge east of the Pike to threaten the US left flank
held by Hayes.  Elements of Averell's cavalry division were in
position to delay this maneuver but withdrew without engaging. 
In conjunction with Ramseur's advance on the CS left, Wharton
attacked about 1500 hours and quickly turned the US left.  Hayes
retreated to the stone walls that lined the Valley Pike and
rallied his brigade, facing east at right angles to the center
held by Mulligan. 
<p><p>
<b>Phase Seven.  US Retreat:</b> Three CS divisions now moved in
concert to envelope the US center.  Mulligan's division was under
fire from three directions.  While trying to direct the defense,
Mulligan himself was pierced by five mini‚ balls and fell
mortally wounded.  ``Lay me down and save the colors!'' he
snapped at the officers who tried to assist him.  The US center
collapsed, and soldiers began streaming to the rear.  Hayes'
brigade stood long enough on the crest of Pritchard's Hill to
allow the US artillery to escape.  Elements of Duffi‚'s cavalry
made a brief counterattack along the Middle Road, buying time for
Thoburn's division to retire in relatively good order.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Eight.  Rear Guard Actions:</b> A brigade of Thoburn's
division made a stand near the toll gate at the intersection of
the Valley Pike and Cedar Creek Grade, while the rest of Crook's
infantry retreated through the streets of Winchester.  Rodes'
division, in the meantime, crossed from the Valley Pike to the
Front Royal Road and marched north to cut off the Federal
retreat, meeting only light opposition from the US cavalry. 
Rodes followed the Federal forces north to Stephenson's Depot,
taking hundreds of prisoners until darkness ended the pursuit. 
The CS cavalry did not advance as Early expected.  The
disorganized Federal army retreated to Bunker Hill where it
regrouped.  Crook continued the retreat before dawn and
eventually reached the Potomac River on 27 July.  For a few days
after the battle, Federal prisoners were held in Star Fort.

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The core of the battlefield, the US center and goal of decisive
CS assaults, is Pritchard's Hill and the Pritchard Farm, owned by
the Charles Hardy Grim Estate.  The ``Pritchard-Grim'' property
(roughly from rte. 652 to Pritchard's Hill and from rte. 628 to
the historic Opequon Church, about 200 acres) is agricultural
land that retains a marked similarity to its Civil War
appearance.  The property features a fine brick antebellum
structure (Pritchard House), a frame tenant house, and several
outbuildings that date from the time of the battle.  Col. James
Mulligan, commander of the Union center, was wounded in front of
and died in the Pritchard House two days after the battle.  The
stone fence defended by Mulligan's infantry still runs along
Pritchard's Lane.  CS forces attacked across the open meadow
south of the house.  Pritchard's Hill served as a Union artillery
strongpoint and was assaulted directly during the battle's
closing phases.
<p><p>
Opequon Church was the focal point of initial fighting; the
original building was destroyed during the war but rebuilt in
1896.  Union accounts describe firing from behind tombstones in
the cemetery.  An adjacent parcel (bounded by rte. 37, Cedar
Creek Grade, and Middle Road to the Winchester city limits) is
primarily agricultural with some new residences along Middle Road
and Cedar Creek Grade.  This land, about 275 acres, was
significant during First Kernstown, and was the location of the
US far right at Second Kernstown, anchored on Sand Ridge until
turned by Ramseur's advance.  Of about 2,200 acres of battlefield
core, excluding Rodes' pursuit and cavalry actions, an estimated
625 acres of contiguous open ground remains.
<p><p>
Ramseur's deployment area on Middle Road is bisected by the four-
lane rte. 37-bypass.  Gordon's deployment area is occupied by an
industrial building and a housing subdivision.  The area where
Wharton made his decisive flanking movement and attack Rutherford
B. Hayes' brigade is occupied by a high density industrial park
along US 11 and the railroad corridor.  Dense industrial and
commercial development characterizes the land adjacent to and
east of US 11.  The Pritchard-Grim property and Pritchard's Hill
are the last portions of open ground south of the Winchester city
limits.
<p><p>
Most historic buildings of old Kernstown have been lost, with the
notable exception of Hoge's Ordinary or Beemer's Tavern, which
has been renovated into office space and anchors a five-acre
office-commercial development.  Taylor provides a useful drawing
of this structure in his sketchbook.  The Frederick County
Historical Society has recently erected new interpretive signs
and a map adjacent to Opequon Church, making the action more
comprehensible to visitors.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Land east of US 11 (Valley Pike) along the railroad tracks has
been developed for a large-scale industrial/business park.  Route
11 is zoned commercial/industrial and has been densely developed
from south of Kernstown to the Winchester city limits, causing
concern over potential development plans west of the highway.  A
new business/office park was recently constructed near the
entrance to the Opequon Church with Hoge's Ordinary as its center
piece.
<p><p>
A county planning official noted, however, that watershed and
ground water considerations make development in the Pritchard's
Hill and Sand Ridge areas less desirable.  These factors would
need to be considered before any development plans would be
approved.  Residential development is encroaching on the northern
part of Pritchard's Hill.  For the present, a large portion of
this land remains in private ownership and has been altered
little since the Civil War.  The Pritchard-Grim farm and adjacent
portions of Pritchard's Hill are owned by the Charles Hardy Grim
Estate.
