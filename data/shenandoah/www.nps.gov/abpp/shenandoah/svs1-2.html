<H2>2. Structure of the Report</H2><p>
<p>
<a href="svs1-1.html">Part One</a> of the report provides an
overview of the project and the study concepts, as well as a
general discussion of growth and development in the Shenandoah
Valley Region, and links these trends to a loss of battlefield
resources.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs2-1.html">Part Two</a> presents the historic
information compiled by the study team to provide a context for
understanding the strategic significance of the Shenandoah Valley
during the Civil War.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs3-1.html">Part Three</a> describes the battles
themselves in some detail with an emphasis on linking battle
events with local sites, features, and landmarks.  The condition
of the battlefields, surviving features, and the perceived level
of threat are described.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs4-1.html">Part Four</a> describes the methodology
used to conduct a field assessment of battlefield integrity and
presents the results of the field survey and of the Geographic
Information System (GIS) analysis of land use patterns.  Sites
are classified by the degree of risk, and site-specific
preservation scenarios are outlined.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs5.html">Part Five</a> presents the findings of an
assessment of the potential for increasing heritage tourism in
the Shenandoah Valley, suggesting that battlefield preservation
could provide long-term economic benefits to the local
economy.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs6-1.html">Part Six</a> presents the study's findings
and examines alternatives for preservation.<p>
<p>
<a href="svs6-5.html">Appendix A</a> contains a bibliography of
sources, including historic maps, used to produce this study.
