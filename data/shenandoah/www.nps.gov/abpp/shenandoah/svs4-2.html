<H2>2. GIS Analysis of Battlefield Integrity</H2>
<p><p>
The field survey form rated battlefield integrity through the
eyes of the survey team.  While these observations are valuable
in terms of how the battlefield landscapes are perceived
subjectively, for the purposes of this study it was deemed
important to find a more objective measure of the loss or
retention of integrity.  For this we turned to the Cultural
Resources GIS Facility for a computer analysis of land use within
the battlefield study and core areas.  Computer mapping and
analysis software, collectively known as Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) were used in this study to create a mosaic map by
combining many different modern and historic maps; to document
study and core areas, to assess current land uses within defined
areas; and to calculate statistics for land parcels.
<p><p>
The battlefield study and core areas were reduced to a computer
format to enable various comparisons.  The average size of study
areas of the fifteen battlefields was 5,727 acres, ranging from
3,082 acres at <a href="svs3-3.html">Front Royal</a> to 22,274
acres at <a href="svs3-7.html">Second Winchester</a>.  The size
of the Front Royal study area accurately reflects the smaller
numbers of troops engaged and their restricted deployment along
the main roads.  Second Winchester, on the other hand, involved a
larger force, a network of Union entrenchments, two sweeping
flank marches by Confederate forces that literally encircled the
town of Winchester, and three days of fighting and maneuvering. 
The study areas of the Valley's two major battles (in terms of
forces engaged and casualties) at
<a href="svs3-12.html">Opequon</a> and
<a href="svs3-15.html">Cedar Creek</a> were 11,670 acres and
15,607 acres respectively.
<p>
Because the study areas of several battlefields overlap, the
total acreage for the study areas of the fifteen battlefields was
85,909 acres, 3.4 percent of the area of the Shenandoah Valley
under consideration.  Battlefield core areas ranged in size from
944 acres at Front Royal to 6,252 acres at Cedar Creek.  The mean
size of the core areas was 2,415 acres.  Total acreage included
in the battlefield core areas was 33,844 acres, 1.4 percent of
the Valley's land area.
<p><p>
<a href="svsfig14.html">Figure 14</a> presents the
integrity of the battlefields as determined by the GIS analysis. 
The percentage of built-up lands was computed for the battlefield
study and core areas, using available 1973 land use data.  These
figures were then updated by on-site field inspections.  In
general, built-up lands, new roads, and quarries were subtracted
from study and core area acreage, to achieve an integrity rating.

One exception was built-up areas that were residential at the
time of the Civil War and that still retain a similar scale and
density, such as the old towns of Winchester, New Market, and
McDowell.  These districts were felt to support battlefield
integrity.  Retention of 75-100 percent natural and agricultural
lands rated ``Good,'' 50-74 percent rated ``Fair,'' 25-49 percent
rated ``Poor,'' and less than 25 percent rated ``Lost.''   As
presented, the GIS analysis reflects the relative integrity of
the battlefields as of 1991.
<p><p>
<a href="svsfig15.html">Figure 15</a> compares the
findings of the field survey with the GIS integrity assessment. 
The field surveyors were more critical of visual intrusions,
particularly of highways, bridges, powerlines, and construction
within the battlefield cores.  Four battlefields ranked good by
GIS were ranked fair by the field survey team:
<a href="svs3-15.html">Cedar Creek</a>,
<a href="svs3-13.html">Fisher's Hill</a>,
<a href="svs3-10.html">Cool Spring</a>,
and <a href="svs3-14.html">Tom's Brook</a>.  Four battlefields
ranked fair by the GIS methodology, were ranked poor by the field
survey: <a href="svs3-7.html">Second Winchester</a>, 
<a href="svs3-11.html">Second Kernstown</a>, and 
<a href="svs3-8.html">New Market</a>.  Both methods agreed on the
goodintegrity of <a href="svs3-2.html">McDowell</a>, 
<a href="svs3-5.html">Cross Keys</a>, 
<a href="svs3-9.html">Piedmont</a>, and
<a href="svs3-6.html">Port Republic</a>, on the fair integrity of
<a href="svs3-1.html">First Kernstown</a>, on the poor integrity
of <a href="svs3-12.html">Opequon</a> and 
<a href="svs3-3.html">Front Royal<a/>, and the lost condition of
<a href="svs3-4.html">First Winchester</a>.  Although the
integrity ranking
derived through GIS differed in these instances from the field
survey rating, both methods cluster the battlefields similarly
toward the top and bottom of the scale.
<p>
The GIS method generates a gross ratio between land of high and
low integrity and does not measure many visual intrusions that
are apparent in the field.  A minor intrusion in terms of acreage
might appear as a major visual intrusion, depending on the
location and setting.  In this sense, the computer is more
forgiving than the critical observer.  This reference data is
crucial, however, for obtaining a more objective view of the
current status of the battlefields.  Where the GIS rating is
considerably higher than the field survey rating, perhaps, visual
intrusions could be removed or masked to improve integrity.  The
GIS assessment will provide a reference point for monitoring
further loss of integrity.
<p><p>
Several interesting facts emerged from a regional analysis of the
battlefield study areas.  The study areas contain a higher
proportion of agricultural land (63 percent) than is the case for
the Valley as a whole (37 percent).  Due to this, changes in
agricultural patterns or loss of agricultural land tend to have a
higher impact on the battlefields than on the overall Valley
landscape.  Forests make up more than 56 percent of the Valley's
acreage but only about 21 percent of battlefield acreage.  This
is accounted for by the fact that the Valley's forests are more
concentrated in the higher elevations, while battles typically
were fought on lower, flatter ground.  In addition, built-up
lands are more concentrated in the battlefield study areas (14
percent) than in the Valley as a whole (6 percent), reflecting
the location of battlefields on or near important towns and
transportation nodes.  A relatively high level of existing
residential development within a battlefield study area indicates
that further development in the vicinity is probable due to
current zoning and continued growth.  Figure 5 shows the <A
