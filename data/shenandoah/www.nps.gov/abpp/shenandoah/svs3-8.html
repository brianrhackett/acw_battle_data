[u] Maj. Gen. <a href="sigel.gif">Franz Sigel</a><p>
<B>Forces Engaged:</B> [c] Two infantry brigades (Echols and
Wharton), VMI cadet battalion, Imboden's cavalry brigade, and
several batteries, totaling about 5,335, 4,087 of which were
engaged; [u] One infantry division under Sullivan (two brigades:

(96k/520w/225m)<p>
<p>
<B>Significance:</B> As part of his 1864 spring offensive, Lt.
Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel to advance
south along the Valley Pike to destroy the railroad at Staunton
and then to move on the rail complex at Lynchburg.  Although
outnumbered, Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, former senator and
vice president of the US, was able to concentrate scattered CS
forces to meet Sigel's army near New Market.  Sigel was
decisively defeated on 15 May 1864, and the Valley remained in
Confederate hands until Maj. Gen. David Hunter renewed the US
offensive on 26 May.  The battle of New Market is noted for the
participation of a battalion of VMI cadets, who distinguished
themselves in combat beside veteran troops.
<p><p>
<hr><p><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  Cavalry Actions:</B> On 14 May 1864, Union cavalry
under Quinn (mainly 1st NY Cav Lincoln) advanced south on the
Valley Pike from Mt. Jackson, driving CS cavalry (18VA) under
Imboden across Meem's Bottom and beyond Rude's Hill, where
defense stiffened.  Reinforced by a brigade of infantry under
Moor, and Wynkoop's cavalry brigade, US forces again advanced
with Imboden withdrawing to New Market.  CS cavalry, fighting
dismounted supported Imboden and established a line south of New
Market behind Shirley's Hill.  The CS line stretched thinly from
Shirley's Hill to Smith Creek.  Federals continued to advance,
launching two attacks about 2000 and 2200 hours, both of which
were repulsed.  After dark, Imboden withdrew farther to the
south, after successfully retarding Sigel's advance.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  CS Advance:</B> After midnight, Breckinridge
brought most of his command north along the Valley Pike from near
Lacey Spring.  By 0600 hours, 15 May, Breckinridge reached the
Shenandoah County line.  He halted near here to reconnoiter and
about 0800 hours sent his cavalry and artillery forward to harass
the US force under Moor at New Market.  CS artillery unlimbered
and fired from Shirley's Hill.  Moor established his line along
the old River Road with artillery on Manor's Hill and in St.
Matthews (currently the Lutheran) cemetery.  The rest of Sigel's
infantry was spread out along the pike as far north as Edinburg. 
Brig. Gen. Julius Stahel arrived about 0830 and ordered Moor to
withdraw some of his troops to Bushong's Hill.  While
Breckinridge waited on the rest of his infantry to reach the
field, US guns at the cemetery and CS guns on Shirley's Hill
exchanged fire.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  US Deployment/ Initial CS Attacks:</B> About
1100 hours, Sigel arrived on the battlefield and established
temporary headquarters at the Rice House.  After reviewing Moor's
dispositions he ordered his line withdrawn to a stronger position
on Bushong's Hill, stretching between a bend in the North Fork
and Smith's Creek.  Sigel brought up 14 guns to support his
position, leaving DuPont's battery at Rude's Hill awaiting
orders.  He placed cavalry on his left flank between the Valley
Pike and Smith's Creek.  Breckinridge deployed on both sides of
the Pike and advanced his infantry in force, driving back US
skirmishers.  Imboden crossed Smith's Creek with his cavalry and
attempted to outflank Sigel by moving north along the east bank. 
By 1230, Sigel had withdrawn entirely from the town of New
Market.  The 18CT and 123OH resisted the CS advance on Manor's
Hill before joining the main battle line at Bushong's.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  Bushong's Hill:</B> About 1400 hours,
Breckinridge launched an all-out assault against the US position
on Bushong's Hill, using the 26VA, 30VA, 51VA, and 62VA.  The
62nd Virginia suffered more than 50 percent casualties.  When the
CS attack stalled under heavy small arms and artillery fire, the
VMI battalion was ordered to fill the gap in the line near the
Bushong House.  About 1445 hours, the US cavalry under Stahel
attacked up the Valley Pike, riding into massed artillery which
Breckinridge had shifted east from Shirley's Hill.  Stahel was
repulsed with heavy casualties.  About 1500 hours, Sigel directed
a confused counterattack, which was soon repulsed.  CS
sharpshooters began picking off Union gunners on Bushong's Hill
north of the farm, and Sigel ordered the batteries withdrawn. 
When the artillery fire slackened, Breckinridge ordered a general
advance and swept the Union line off Bushong's Hill.  In this
assault, the VMI cadets captured a gun and many men of the 34MA. 
To the east near the Valley Pike, elements of the 34MA and 54PA
continued to resist, covering the Union retreat.  These regiments
were eventually driven back, and the Union forces began a general
retreat.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.  Rear Guard Actions:</B> On his own initiative,
Capt. Henry DuPont (US) brought up his battery to cover the
retreat.  He unlimbered first near the Harshburger House, then
withdrew his pieces rearward en echelon as the Confederates
advanced.  Sigel fell back to his supports at the Cedar Grove
Dunker Church and cemetery and organized a holding action, while
his confused troops reorganized.  DuPont's artillery continued to
slow the pursuit.  About 1630 hours, Breckinridge ordered a halt
to regroup confronting the US line at Cedar Grove Church. 
Imboden's cavalry returned from their fruitless effort to get in
rear of Sigel's army to burn the Meem's Bottom Bridge across the
North Fork (the creeks were swollen with rainfall).  An artillery
duel continued until about 1700 hours.  Breckinridge was unable
to organize another attack and, by 1900 hours, the Union army
escaped across the North Fork and burned the bridge.  Sigel
retreated down the Valley Pike rapidly, leaving his badly wounded
at Mt. Jackson.  He arrived at Strasburg on the following day.

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The Virginia Military Institute owns battlefield land and
operates a museum and visitor center.  New Market is one of two
Valley battlefields that currently has facilities for visitors,
the other being Cedar Creek.
<p><p>
The New Market Battlefield Historical Park was established by VMI
in 1967.  The Hall of Valor was constructed on the battlefield
and opened in 1970.  The park contains about 280 acres: 24 acres
of Shirley's Hill (recently acquired), about 40 acres east of I-
81 around the Pennsylvania monument, and about 215 acres at the
Hall of Valor parcel adjacent to the steep bluffs overlooking the
North Fork Shenandoah River.  The park protects and preserves
about ten percent of the core area of the New Market battlefield,
but this includes several areas of the most severe infantry
fighting.  The cavalry field, east of US 11 to Smith's Creek,
remains farmland.  The village of New Market is listed in the
National Register as a historic district.
<p><p>
In spite a degree of the protection afforded by the battlefield
park, the field survey integrity of the battlefield was rated
low, due to the fragmented nature of the park and the prominent
positioning of I-81, which is the most obtrusive feature.  I-81
bisects the battlefield and battlefield park, and interchange 67
of I-81 empties at the base of Manor's and Shirley's Hill.  The
park is limited in its ability to interpret its separate parcels
at Shirley's Hill, Bushong's Hill, and at the Pennsylvania
monument.
<p><p>
Two monuments were erected by veterans on the New Market
battlefield and these are contained within the VMI battlefield
park.  The Missouri (Woodson) monument near the Bushong House
commemorates the role of Co. A, 1st Missouri cavalry that fought
in the battle.  The second monument commemorates the role of the
54th Regiment Pennsylvania infantry, located directly east of
Bushong's Hill but separated from the main park by I-81.
<p><p>
North on US 11 between New Market and the Pennsylvania Monument
parcel there is light commercial and residential development,
although this strip development is less dense than that south of
town.  New construction has occurred on Manor's Hill on ground
associated with the opening phases of the battle along the access
road to the battlefield park (rte. 619) north of rte. 211.  This
includes a large Day's Inn Motel and the New Market Battlefield
Military Museum.  The exhibits of the Military Museum cover all
American wars with special emphasis on the Civil War.  Monuments
on the grounds were erected by the museum.
<p><p>
The vicinity of Rude's Hill, Meem's Bottom, Mt. Airy, and the
Cedar Grove Church is prime agricultural land that preserves the
rural-historic integrity of this area.  Meem's Bottom and Rude's
Hill were the scene of many armed encounters during the war
because these features formed a ``choke point'' on the Valley
Turnpike.  Confederate cavalry defended the North Fork Shenandoah
River crossing and used Rude's Hill as an observation post.  The
well preserved estate, Mt. Airy, served as a way station for
Confederate staff officers and partisans, including Henry Kyd
Douglas and Harry Gilmor.  Although not included directly in the
battlefield study area, Meem's Bottom and Mt. Airy should be
considered supporting resources.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The battlefield park is divided into at least four separate
parcels.  The I-81 interchange has spawned a commercial strip
that physically and visually separates the northern and southern
portions of the main field of action.  The interstate itself
divides the battlefield east and west.  The view from Shirley's
Hill to the Lutheran (St. Matthews) Cemetery looks directly over
a commercial strip and the large signs that are typical along
interstates.  A large motel complex has been constructed between
St. Matthews Cemetery and the interstate highway.  Two parcels of
land at the base of Shirley's Hill along rte. 211 (about 5 acres)
are zoned commercial.  New construction at these sites would
further degrade the important view from Shirley's Hill.  New
residential construction north of town along US 11 in the
vicinity of the Pennsylvania momument has continued the process
of fragmentation.
