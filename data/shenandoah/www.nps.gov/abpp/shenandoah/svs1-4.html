<H2>4. Study Concepts</H2><p>
<p>
The Shenandoah Valley study proceeded in three stages:
documentary research; field survey and verification; and mapping.
<p><p>
During the field portion of the study, several problems emerged
pertaining to the definition of a battlefield.  The extent of a
battlefield is not easily defined because there is not always a
definite starting or stopping point.  A battle is joined through
the fluid motion of armies across the landscape, leading to
encounter, confrontation, violent interaction, and
disengagement.<p>
<p>
Before attempting to circumscribe a battlefield, it is essential
to understand the size and nature of the opposing forces, the
relevant military objectives, the importance of terrain to the
direction and outcome of the battle, and to consider the
interaction of military actions before, during, and after the
battle.  Due to these factors, some battles were confined to
relatively small geographic areas, while others were large,
sprawling affairs with military activities of various kinds
directed over a large area.
<p>
<p>
The field evaluation form that was used, separated each battle
into phases and attempted to capture the movements of forces
across the landscape, rather than relying on the approach of most
forms designed to evaluate a static, historic landscape. 
Important period features were identified from battle accounts
and descriptions and were located on the map when these could be
identified.  These features, which included terrain features,
roads, buildings and structures, and other place names, were
referred to as defining features  because when mapped they tend
to define the extent of the battlefield on the landscape.
<p>
<p>
In each case, battle was judged to begin when hostile forces
began responding to each other's presence and maneuvering to
ensure confrontation.  For purposes of mapping, a battlefield
study area was drawn to encompass all important components of the
conflict.  These components might include approach routes, areas
of troop concentrations, reserve positions, a commander's
headquarters, signal stations or other important observation
points, picket lines, battle lines, maneuver areas, assault
areas, artillery positions, retreat routes, and places where the
armies bivouacked before or after the fighting when these are
nearby.  The study area is viewed as providing a strategic
context and geographic setting for understanding the conflict in
question.
<p>
<p>
A core area was then identified for each battlefield.  Core areas
included those areas of confrontational deployment, heaviest
fighting, and most severe casualties.  In modern military
parlance, this is known frankly as the ``killing zone.''
Occasionally plotted as part of the core were sites which were
important in shaping the ebb and flow of battle, even when
fighting at these sites was minimal.  These satellite areas might
include river crossings, crossroads, signal stations, or other
features that contributed to the battle's development and
outcome.
<p>
<p>
Outlining study and core areas on the map is a subjective, but
necessary, process, if we are to understand where and how these
events occurred.  In most cases, study and core outlines were
drawn to follow the nearest physical feature, such as a road,
creek, ravine, woods or ridge line.  Further research will
undoubtedly refine the study areas, but the adjustments should be
slight and involve a reinterpretation of the importance or
location of more peripheral battle events.  The study team,
historians, and other consulted parties are in agreement over the
locations of the primary battle activities included in the core
areas.  As mapped on the USGS quadrants and reproduced in GIS
format, each battlefield is contained by its study area and
defined more closely by its core.  
<p>
<p>
The study and core area outlines, as used here, do not constitute
proposed park ``boundaries.'' Boundaries for battlefield parks,
whether national, State, or local, rarely coincide with the
actual size of the battles, but rather represent decisions to set
aside specific land parcels as parks.  Such decisions typically
include factors in addition to the historic events, such as the
National Park Service criteria for suitability and feasibility
(see <a href="svs6-1.html">Part Six</a>).  These criteria can
cover such considerations as availability of land, funding,
management structure, local land use plans, or other priorities. 
Thus, most National Park System battlefields do not encompass all
significant areas associated with a battle.  As used here, study
and core area outlines are an attempt to display the extent of
the battle on the landscape based on historic sources. 
Management considerations are not addressed.  
<p>
<p>
The 15 battlefields are located to the west of the existing
Shenandoah National Park.  Front Royal and Port Republic have
small portions of their study areas (112 and 85 acres
respectively) in existing park ownership.  Portions of these two
battlefields (215 acres of Front Royal's study area, and 1,098
acres of Port Republic's study and core areas) are within the
authorized boundaries of the park.  The study areas of Piedmont
and Cross Keys are relatively close to the authorized boundaries
of the park, but GIS analysis has determined that the boundaries
do not intersect.  No management recommendations will be made by
the National Park Service to include these areas within
Shenandoah National Park.
