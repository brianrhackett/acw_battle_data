<H2>3. Alternatives</H2>
<p><p>
The following alternatives are presented in order of increasing
Federal involvement.  Alternative I examines no increased action,
that is, the continuation of the status quo in terms of existing
preservation and interpretation activities of battlefield sites. 
Alternative II examines the possibility of mounting a local or
regional effort, with or without assistance from the National
Park
Service, to preserve battlefield land for interpretation and
tourism.  Alternative III examines the potential of developing
these sites as affiliated areas of the National Park System. 
Alternative IV examines the possibility of acquiring one or more
specific battlefields, for incorporation into the National Park
System.  Alternative V examines the possibility of acquiring all
fifteen battlefields for incorporation into the National Park
System.  Cost estimates for Alternatives I-V are presented in <a
href="svsfig22.html">Figure 22</a>, however, potential
acquisition costs for land have not been estimated in the
analysis
due to the complexity of ownership and land use in the
battlefields.
<p><p>
Although the historic significance of the Valley calls for a
regional approach towards its preservation and interpretation, it
is clear that a variety of owner interests, local government
goals
and objectives, current land use patterns, and varied levels of
threat to the battlefields are present.  This suggests an
approach
that would consider various combinations of the five
alternatives. 
Such an approach could be implemented, based on need, owner
interest, and other concerns.  Indeed, property owners and
preservation organizations, with input from local governments and
the travel and tourism industry, have begun to meet to explore
preservation strategies that reflect this approach.
<p>
Because historic preservation is most successful when the local
community is supportive and has participated in the
identification and implementation of preservation solutions. 
Selection of any of these alternatives should be accomplished
after opportunities for public information and participation in
the selection process have occurred.  At this time, such
consultation has not been extensive.  The Valley Conservation
Council, a non-profit conservation organization located in
Staunton, Virginia, has stressed the need for public information
on these issues and the formulation of long-term strategies for
ensuring that private and local interests will be a major
participant in the future. 
<p>
<hr><p>
<H2>I. No Action, Continuation of Status Quo</H2>
<p>
An examination of current preservation and interpretive
activities provides a base line for evaluating the advantages and
disadvantages of other potential alternatives.  Under this
alternative, existing private and public efforts to preserve
battlefields would continue without substantial changes.  These
programs include: Federal income tax deductions for donation of
easements and credits for substantial rehabilitations of income
generating certified historic structures; Federal and matching
State funding through the Historic Preservation Fund, and Land
and Water Conservation Fund; donation of easements through the
State's open space and historic easement program, and additional
State programs designed to encourage the retention of
agricultural and forest lands.
<p>
This alternative may be more feasible in the Upper Valley and,
specifically, in areas where agriculture remains a healthy
industry.  In Augusta County, several private property owners
have indicated to NPS their desire to continue farming-- a
practice that is generally consistent with the historic character
of the battlefields.  Representatives of this county government
also indicated their belief that local zoning efforts, especially
the use of agricultural-forest districts, were sufficient to
preserve battlefields from incompatible land use development. 
The problem, however, is that zoning is ephemeral, and in rural
areas re-zoning at the request of the land owners occurs as a
matter of course.  In addition, approximately 10 percent of core
battlefield land distributed throughout the Valley is owned by
non-profit organizations committed to its preservation.  Several
Valley organizations and property owners have stressed that
Federal acquisition from private owners unwilling to sell their
property would undermine community support for preservation of
Civil War battlefields in the Valley.  Although no additional
expenditures of public funds would occur under this alternative,
the result would be haphazard resource protection,
interpretation, reduced heritage tourism potential, and, notably,
potential reliance in the future on more costly preservation
alternatives.
<p>
Alternative I could be used selectively in conjunction with the
other alternatives presented in this study, so that enhanced
preservation and interpretation efforts outlined in Alternatives
II, III, IV, and V could be focused on critically threatened
battlefields, and in areas where private and local government
support is present.
<p>
<hr><p>
<H2>II.  Enhanced Public Funding and Technical Assistance to
State and Local Governments and Private Owners For Battlefield
Preservation and Interpretation</H2>
<p>
Alternative II includes increased preservation and interpretation
for battlefield sites that would require Federal, State, and
local action through a variety of assistance methods short of
acquisition in fee.  Perhaps more so in this alternative than in
the others is the need for focus and coordination on three
interdependent areas: preservation, interpretation, and
promotion.  Preservation of the sites is of primary importance,
for without adequate protection, the historic battlefield
resources will continue to slip away and their potential value
for interpretation and visitation gradually will be lost.  In
order to increase visitation and public appreciation of these
sites, it is necessary first to improve the infrastructure and
materials available to interpret events for visitors.  These
three areas will be examined in turn.
<p>
<b>i. Preservation.</b>  The pace of resource degradation in the
Valley and the loss of agricultural acreage over the last two
decades, especially in the northern part, reveals that continued
dependence on the coincidence of interests between private
landowners and public interest in historic preservation is no
longer an adequate mechanism for ensuring protection of
battlefield land.  Lands that are currently protected, either by
ownership, easements, or zoning, do not represent a large amount
(10 percent) of core historical areas in the fifteen
battlefields.  Continuing degradation and loss of Civil War
battlefield resources is expected to occur, particularly in the
lower Valley, and areas immediately adjacent to interstate
highways, where land use is shifting away from agriculture. 
Unlike the situation in Augusta County, local officials in
Frederick and Clarke Counties, and the City of Winchester, have
noted that reliance on local zoning will not be effective in
protecting battlefield lands in their jurisdictions.  The use of
these resources for interpretation and tourism will diminish with
time.  Both market (economic) and non-market (personal
benefit/enjoyment) benefits will decline. 
<p>
Preservation methods under this alternative would need to focus
on increasing the effectiveness of private methods of protection
and developing methods that provide for public and private
cooperation.  To meet with success in the Valley, methods would
need to be consistent with other community goals and be
sufficiently flexible to assist a variety of specific needs.  The
types of activities that would be needed are presented in <a
href="svsfig20.html">Figure 20</a>.  Many parts of
battlefields--especially in the middle and upper Valley--are on
privately owned agricultural land whose owners wish to continue
that way of life.  A program could be initiated--perhaps through
the Historic Preservation Fund--whereby long-term (say 10-15
holding years) battlefield protection contracts are entered into
between a willing property owner and an appropriate governmental
or non-profit entity.  These contracts (modeled after the
Countryside Stewardship program in England) would pay an owner an
appropriate, market-derived stipend in return for the owner
agreeing to maintain, restore, or enhance some battlefield
amenity: clear or keep cleared a field that was open at the time
of the battle, maintain a viewshed, provide limited access to
some location, maintain a series of rail fences or other
infrastructure such as a footpath or footbridge, an interpretive
wayside or kiosk on or adjacent to their land, and so on.  In
this way, not only do owners retain their land and landuse, but
they participate in and take responsibility for some part of the
battlefield's preservation and presentability to the public while
putting their participation on a business basis.  Ten-year
contracts between the government and landowners target specific
areas and allow flexible guidelines to reflect individual owner
and community needs.  
<p>
Public support for such largely site maintenance or restoration
technical assistance actions could come either through increased
appropriations to existing joint Federal and State grant
programs--the Historic Preservation Fund and the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, or through new law to provide increased
preservation and interpretation activities.  Legislation may also
be necessary to limit or remove liability from landowners who
allow public access to battlefields.  Similar law already exists
in Virginia to protect landowners who allow fox hunting on their
property and perhaps this approach can be adapted to historic
site visitation.   
<p>
Since economic considerations typically provide the basis for
most decisions that result in changing land use and loss of
battlefield land, the development of financial incentives to
private owners to preserve battlefield lands may need to be
considered.  Strategies could include tax incentives to owners of
battlefield land that do not subdivide property for new
construction.  Since local governments derive significant
revenues through property taxes, Federal and State financial
incentives to local governments that develop zoning and other
land use ordinances compatible with battlefield preservation
could also be considered.  Modifications to estate taxes as in
the proposed ``Open Space Preservation Act'' (HR2149, HR5469,
S2957) is another key approach that would make retention of
undeveloped or agricultural uses feasible for many owners.  
<p>
Regulatory methods, such as zoning or historic preservation
ordinances, require less funding than grant and financial
incentive programs but may pose significant difficulties in
gaining widespread public support at the local level.  In rural
areas, as in much of the Shenandoah Valley, zoning and land use
controls are typically less restrictive than in urban areas, and
consequently, are less likely to be effective for preserving
historic battlefields.  Therefore, it may not be realistic to
expect the Commonwealth of Virginia and the local governments in
the Valley to enact land use ordinances that would favor
preservation of battlefields over the capability of private
owners to develop property to its highest and best use.  However,
technical and financial assistance from State and Federal sources
to local governments in return for enactment of compatible land
use ordinances may be appropriate in some cases.   State and
local government financing methods such as a tax on tourism-
related services, in which the tax revenues are applied to the
purchase of development rights or to fund other preservation and
interpretation activities that are directly related to heritage
tourism, may be a more viable State and local contribution to
Federally-funded activities.
<p>
At a minimum, it is desirable for all local governments in the
Valley to follow the example of Augusta County and incorporate
detailed information on the location, significance, and condition
of historic sites in their local comprehensive plan.  The
ability, through this means, to alert any potential developer --
public or private -- to the existence of important historic sites
is one of the most feasible and valuable ways to avoid
unmanageable future conflicts.
<p>
<b>ii.  Interpretation.</b>  Battlefields are not without their
own economic attractions.  An estimated several thousand people
visit these battlefields each year despite the lack of
interpretive facilities, signage, and public access.  This small
but steady visitation by military historians, history buffs,
genealogists, and Civil War enthusiasts will continue
indefinitely providing that the historic resources remain in good
condition.  If these resources are degraded and diverted to other
uses, visitation will stop.  On the other hand, there is evidence
that enhancing facilities, signage, and public access, devising
useful interpretive materials, and preparing a unified marketing
strategy for the Valley's Civil War resources, would increase the
drawing power of these sites and thus provide a stronger economic
incentive for preserving and interpreting battlefield land.
<p>
Many local jurisdictions, county and city, expressed a great
interest in promoting the tourism potential of Civil War sites in
the Valley, particularly in light of a national resurgence of
interest in the Civil War, spurred by commemorative reenactments,
the PBS series ``The Civil War,'' and related developments.  Most
counties in the Valley see tourism as an increasingly important
potential source of revenue.  It is not clear, however, what form
Civil War heritage tourism in the Valley would take, considering
the current level of restricted access to many of these sites and
the understandable concerns of landowners to maintain their
security and privacy.  Nor is it apparent to what extent local
property owners, businesses, and governments wish to control the
use of historic properties toward such ends.  
<p>
In order to enhance the interpretation of the role of the
Shenandoah Valley in the Civil War, an effort could be mounted,
perhaps assisted by the National Park Service, to develop a
preliminary interpretive plan for the region.  To focus and
coordinate interpretive activities over the next five years, a
clearinghouse could be established to enhance the public
appreciation of Shenandoah Valley Civil War sites.  This
clearinghouse could prepare and disseminate interpretive
materials and generally encourage interpretive and commemorative
activities at Civil War sites in the region.  The clearinghouse
could provide technical assistance to support State and local
interpretive efforts, and monitor the progress of such efforts.
<p>
<b>iii. Promotion.</b>  State and local governments, chambers of
commerce, private property owners, and representatives of the
Valley tourism industry could work together to incorporate Civil
War sites into regional and county economic development plans to
develop heritage tourism.  A specific economic benefits analysis
could be conducted to generate concrete data regarding the market
potential for the sites as tourist attractions.  A plan could be
developed to coordinate regionwide the activities of visitor
centers, museums, and other facilities, and encourage bus tours,
weekend packages, and other options to enhance the visitation of
Civil War sites, along with other attractions in the Valley.  A
schedule of Civil War related events could be developed and
publicized to stimulate wider interest in the Valley sites,
leading to enhanced local community participation in and
increased visitation of commemorative and recreational events. 
<p>
<b>Implementation of Alternative II</b>
The potential complexity of Alternative II suggests regional
coordination would be necessary.  Several options could be
considered:  
<p>
1.A new agency or board composed of representatives from local
government, property owners, local preservation groups, and the
Virginia Department of Historic Resources could be formed to
develop priorities and implement preservation and interpretation
activities.
<p>
2.A new agency or board composed of representatives of existing
planning or government organizations, tourism and business
groups, and preservation organizations could be formed to examine
the economic effects of preservation and interpretation
activities.
<p>
3.A regional office of a State agency such as the Virginia
Department of Historic Resources could be established in the
Valley.  This State organization, with expertise in preservation
planning, administering Federal and State grant programs, and
easements, could implement many technical assistance activities.
<p>
4.An existing regional organization such as a regional planning
authority or an interested private organization could take a lead
role in coordinating preservation and interpretation of
battlefield sites.
<p>
Implementing Alternative II may be appropriate in areas where
public information, additional planning, and enhanced funding for
technical assistance have been identified as necessary first
steps in preserving and interpreting battlefields.  The National
Park Service found little regional coordination in sharing
planning data, although various Federal, local, and regional
agencies, and James Madison University, expressed willingness to
coordinate data collection efforts.  Alternative II will require
a multi-year commitment for technical assistance and funding to
develop a public consensus, set priorities for preservation and
interpretation efforts, and implement the activities. 
Recognition that such planning is necessary is evident in the
comments from various local governments on preservation and
interpretation needs.  Representatives of several Valley
preservation organizations, and counties such as Rockingham,
Clarke, and Shenandoah, stated in their written comments on the
draft study that a variety of methods, requiring Federal
expertise and financial assistance, would be needed to implement
immediate and long term solutions.  Reliance on local government
efforts through zoning and other local regulatory methods was not
viewed as sufficient, or appropriate, in light of the national
significance of these properties.
<p>
Implementation of Alternative II could occur in conjunction with
Alternatives I, III, and IV.  Strategies in Alternative II would
work best where private and local cooperative efforts are
determined by the local government as preferred solutions, as
pre-planning prior to any Congressional implementation of
Alternatives III and IV, or to reinforce preservation and
interpretation of areas surrounding a unit of the National Park
System. 
<p>
Should Alternative II be implemented, Congress may wish to ask
the National Park Service, or some other appropriate party or
organization, to report at a later time on the progress of
preservation efforts in the Valley.  Such a report would reassess
those battlefields that have received technical assistance and
update information on the desirability for the incorporation of
any or all of the Shenandoah Valley Civil War battlefields or
related sites as units or affiliated areas of the National Park
System.  Such a report would also assess the level of resources
and funding needed to ensure that NPS standards for affiliated
areas would be met.
<p>
<hr><p>
<H2>III. Creation of One or More Affiliated Areas of the National
Park System</H2>
Affiliated area status is a mechanism for recognition of
nationally significant areas managed by others consistent with
standards that apply to the National Park System.  These areas
are sometimes eligible for receiving technical and financial
assistance, but this assistance is limited to carrying out a
cooperative management agreement with the National Park Service. 
In 1990, the National Park Service submitted to Congress,
pursuant to P.L. 100-336, a report on criteria for affiliated
areas of the National Park System.  In this present report, the
NPS criteria recommended for such areas (national significance,
suitability, and feasibility, are being applied for purposes of
analyzing Shenandoah Valley sites.  A property proposed for
acquisition as an affiliated area of the National Park System
should meet the same criteria for significance that are applied
to a potential national park unit (<a
href="svsfig21.html">see Figure 21</a>).  The criteria for
suitability and feasibility, however, are different for
affiliated area status, and are outlined in the discussion below.
<p>
When applying the criteria for national significance the study
shows that the Shenandoah Valley represents a unique geographic
and historic resource; that it possesses tremendous scenic beauty
and exceptional potential for interpreting aspects of the Civil
War that are currently not represented in the park system; that
opportunities for recreation are already aptly demonstrated by
the Valley's active tourism industry, by activities in Shenandoah
National Park, and by canoeing and fishing in the region's rivers
and streams; and that many portions of the Valley retain a high
degree of historic, rural, and scenic integrity.
<p>
While it is clear that the Shenandoah Valley region, with its
significant battlefield areas, needs special recognition and
technical assistance beyond what is currently available, there is
no existing mechanism for ensuring a cooperative arrangement
between landowners and the National Park Service that would
assure long-term protection of the resources.  In the absence of
such an arrangement, the other requirements applicable to
National Park System units--contributions from other sources, and
the continuation of standards for maintenance, operations, and
financial accountability--cannot be applied.  This is not to say
that some arrangement would not be possible in the future as a
follow up to the technical assistance activities described under
Alternative II.
<p>
There is currently no regional agency which serves to coordinate
planning between the State level and local jurisdictions or to
facilitate activities in support of the preservation and
interpretation of Civil War sites in the Valley.  Local planning
officials were asked about the need for such an entity at a
meeting held in August 1991, and those present agreed that it was
essential.  Some favored enhanced responsibilities given to an
existing agency, such as the two planning districts which serve
the Valley--the Lord Fairfax Planning District and the Central
Shenandoah Planning District.  Others suggested the possibility
of establishing a regional office of the Virginia Department of
Historic Resources in the Valley to coordinate a regional effort.

Others felt that no existing agency could adequately meet these
added responsibilities.  All agreed, however, that some mechanism
needs to be created, if possible with Federal assistance, to
implement the process.  Written comments on the draft report also
reflected these concerns.  However, representatives of Warren
County, where Cedar Creek battlefield is located, did not provide
comments on the draft report, or participate in the August 1991
NPS / local government meeting on preservation alternatives. 
(Although the Lord Fairfax Planning Commission, representing
Warren County, among others, has participated regularly in the
preparation of this report and in recent preservation efforts.
Warren county has participated in these regional planning
efforts.)  The controversial related lands study for Shenandoah
National Park, occuring simultaneously with this report, may have
resulted in misunderstandings that the two reports were the same.
<p>
The controversy surrounding the related lands study for the park
may influence the nature of comments received from the public and
private citizens on this report, and for preservation efforts in
the Valley for this sites.   
<p>
The Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites and other
locally based preservation groups, such as the Cedar Creek
Battlefield Foundation and the Shenandoah Valley Civil War
Foundation, have expressed interest in exploring a cooperative
arrangement with the National Park Service for incorporating
their landholdings as parks or as affiliated areas.  Without the
demonstrated support of local governments and residents, however,
leading to a more widespread, community-based planning and
preservation effort, such arrangements alone would be inadequate
and premature, considering the size and significance of the
resources. 
<p><hr>
<H2>IV. Acquisition of Selected Battlefields for a Unit of the
National Park System with Satellite Areas</H2>

Consideration could be given to creating a park unit of one or
more selected battlefield sites.  These battlefields would become
regional focal points for preserving and interpreting other non-
Federally owned battlefields at the local level through
strategies discussed in Alternative II.
<p>
<b>National Significance</b>
<p>
The battlefields identified in this study collectively appear to
meet criteria for national significance.  The study shows that
the Shenandoah Valley represents a unique geographic and historic
resource; that it possesses tremendous scenic beauty and
exceptional potential for interpreting aspects of the Civil War
that are currently not represented in the National Park System;
that opportunities for recreation are already aptly demonstrated
by the Valley's active tourism industry, by activities in
Shenandoah National Park, and by canoeing and fishing in the
region's rivers and streams; and that many portions of the Valley
retain a high degree of historic, rural, and scenic integrity.
<p>
Careful consideration is needed under this alternative to select
battlefields that ensure adequate representation of the
Shenandoah Valley Civil War period.  Selection of one or more
sites from each of the major campaigns; selection of two sites,
one from the lower Valley and one from the upper Valley, are two
approaches.  This alternative does not eliminate Federal
commitment to implement programs and activities beyond
acquisition and park operating expenses.  In fact, such
activities would be necessary in order to meet criterion 3 for
national significance.  The ability to provide ``superlative
opportunities for recreation, public use and enjoyment, or for
scientific study,'' as the criterion states, would be diminished
as the number of battlefields preserved, either through NPS
acquisition, as recipients of Federal funding, or through
coordinated non-Federal means are decreased.
<p>
<b>Suitability and Feasibility</b>
<p>
The strategic role of the Shenandoah Valley as a region during
the Civil War, Stonewall Jackson's 1862 Campaign and the Early-
Sheridan 1864 campaigns, are not currently represented in the
National Park System.  Less than 4% of the land area of
battlefield sites in the Valley are under long-term protected
ownership.  This appears to meet criterion 5 for suitability.
<p>
Sufficient size and appropriate configuration are difficult to
evaluate at this time since specific sites have not been
selected.  However, the risk priorities can be used as a guide to
making these selections.  Additional guidance can be given in
evaluating acquisition strategies.  It is commonly recognized
that less land is needed to interpret battlefields, thus
satisfying the public use criterion, than to preserve the
battlefields.  The criteria, however, require both.  Acquisition
of limited acreage under this alternative for interpretive
purposes is not sufficient to ensure long-term protection of the
battlefields identified in this study.  At the very least,
acquisition of selected sites must be performed in conjunction
with long term protection strategies that address preservation of
all battlefield core areas in order to meet criterion 3. 
Criteria 9 and 10, which address feasibility, speak directly to
these issues.  Is it feasible to administer selected battlefield
sites, which represent a portion of the nationally significant
battlefield resources in the Valley, with long-term preservation
less secure for the remaining sites?  While technical assistance
is an integral part of this alternative, ownership, and community
sentiment changes over time.  Administration of a park unit of
limited battlefield land, without adequate long term community
and owner support, may result in Federal expenditures to protect
a fragment of land that does not adequately represent or protect
the resource.  This would most probably occur if an adequate
program of technical assistance does not take place.  
<p>
In summary, this alternative provides a less costly approach than
full acquisition of all battlefield sites, but it carries
inherent risks that should be anticipated in any authorization. 
This approach would require less direct Federal involvement in
managing the areas and would allow flexibility in approaches to
other sites.  To be successful in maintaining the regional
``picture'' of the war, this approach would have to include a
Federal commitment beyond the acquisition and operation of the
park unit.  In addition, specific commitment from local
jurisdictions to work with the National Park Service in
prioritizing preservation would also be necessary, as stated in
Alternative II.  
<p>
The advantage of Alternative IV would be its provision for
protection in perpetuity for some battlefield land in areas where
it is consistent with local community goals and where property
owners are supportive.  This strategy appears to have support
from the City of Winchester, Frederick and Highland counties, and
several of the organizations that commented on the draft report. 
Other counties, such as Rockingham and Shenandoah, have suggested
that NPS acquisition of properties in core areas may be
appropriate in conjunction with other forms of technical and
financial assistance outlined in Alternative II.  However, these
counties pointed out that further analysis of public sentiment
and of the economic benefits of preservation was needed.
<p>
The disadvantages in this alternative would be the potential for
preservation concentration on a limited amount of battlefield
land and the potential neglect of the others.  This may be true
especially if the site has a large core area itself, such as
Cedar Creek.  Without an adequate technical assistance component
for the remaining battlefields, it is possible that designation
of one or two sites as parks could create a hierarchy which would
stimulate competition rather than cooperation among sites in the
region.  Since the authorization and implementation process can
take years, creation of a park unit may not occur in time to save
critically threatened battlefield lands unless interim protection
alternatives also take place.  Perhaps most importantly, the
absence of adequate technical assistance and specific funding to
secure preservation of non-Federally owned battlefield lands may
ultimately place the Federal government in a position of
advocating local preservation goals without the ability to
influence public policy decisions.  Without sufficient support
beyond the funds necessary for the management of the park unit,
Federal advocacy of preservation and interpretation outside the
park boundaries may be viewed as contrary to the local community
goals, or as inappropriate intervention into private and local
government decision making.
<p>

<p>
<H2>Alternative V: Acquisition of Fifteen Battlefields as a Unit
of the National Park System</H2>
<p>
<b>National Significance</b>
<p>
As stated previously, the battlefields identified in the study
collectively appear to meet criteria for national significance. 
The study shows that the Shenandoah Valley represents a unique
geographic and historic resource; that it possesses tremendous
scenic beauty and exceptional potential for interpreting aspects
of the Civil War that are currently not represented in the
National Park System; that opportunities for recreation are
already aptly demonstrated by the Valley's active tourism
industry, by activities in Shenandoah National Park, and by
canoeing and fishing in the region's rivers and streams; and that
many portions of the Valley retain a high degree of historic,
rural, and scenic integrity.   
<p>
<b>Suitability</b>
<p>
As stated in the previous alternative, the strategic role of the
Shenandoah Valley as a region during the Civil War, Stonewall
Jackson's 1862 Campaign, and the Early-Sheridan 1864 campaigns,
are not currently represented in the National Park System.  The
Shenandoah National Park provides natural and recreational
opportunities but is not an effective or appropriate resource for
systematically interpreting the events of the Civil War, even
though many of the important Blue Ridge gaps that shaped so much
of the fighting in this region are within its boundaries,
including Chester, Thornton, Fishers, Browns, and Swift Run gaps.
<p>
Currently, only the battlefields of New Market and Cedar Creek
offer public access and some degree of interpretation for
portions of these sites.  New Market Battlefield Park, owned by
the Virginia Military Institute, offers interpretation of the war
and battle at its Hall of Valor museum. The privately owned New
Market Battlefield Military Museum, located on a portion of the
battlefield, exhibits Civil War memorabilia.  Belle Grove (at
Cedar Creek) is a National Trust for Historic Preservation
property, with adjacent holdings by a private, non-profit
organization, the Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation.  The
Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), a
private, non-profit preservation organization, owns property at
and allows public access to portions of the McDowell, Fisher's
Hill, and Port Republic battlefields.  Another non-profit, the
Lee-Jackson Foundation, owns property at McDowell and Cross Keys.
<p>
A Winchester-based Civil War re-enactment group owns acreage that
allows public access to Star Fort.  Due to the budgets of these
organizations, the size of land holdings and the amount of
interpretation offered on-site are limited. Although the Holy
Cross Abbey preserves much of the Cool Spring battlefield and
allows some visitation, preservation of this site is due more to
coincidence of intent than to acquisition for preservation
purposes.  Similarly, many private holdings, especially for
agricultural use, currently preserve battlefield land through
coincidence of purpose, but these coincidences can change unless
steps are taken to reinforce current land use.  When compared
with the number, size, and significance of the Civil War sites in
the Shenandoah Valley, these holdings by private groups are
insufficient in themselves to preserve any of the fifteen
battlefields.  In summary, it appears criterion 1 for national
significance has been met, the battlefields are suitable for
acquisition, based on their historic significance, lack of
representation in the system, and lack of other protection
strategies or opportunities for public benefit already in place. 
<p>
<b>Feasibility</b>
<p>
The protection of the Shenandoah Valley region, its geographic,
topographic and economic features which were historically
important in the conduct of the Civil War, is a large task. 
Decision making with regard to development and change in the
Valley remains in the hands of State and local governments. 
Planning decisions made at this level have already affected
change not only in the region as a whole, but on the battlefield
lands themselves.  Urban development has destroyed portions of
battlefields in Winchester, Frederick County, and Front Royal, in
particular.
<p>
Is it feasible, however, to consider the creation of a unit of
the National Park System, composed of discontiguous sites, from
the battlefield areas alone?  First, major road developments
initiated by the Federal government, such as Interstates 81 and
66, have already bisected and in a measure degraded many
battlefield areas.  The study shows that First Winchester and
Front Royal have had major integrity losses.  Of the remaining
battlefields, four have been decidedly altered, mostly by urban
development.  This leaves nine battlefields with a range of fair
to good integrity. This means that the total resource has already
experienced impact and is likely to continue to do so unless
preservation solutions are sufficiently comprehensive.
<p>
Second, the nature of land ownership in the region is complex. 
The total number of owners on the fifteen battlefields may reach
several hundred.  Some rural battlefield areas are owned by more
than 30 parties, with a range of uses.  Publicly-owned areas, as
parks or facilities such as sewage treatment plants, are present.
<p>
Some owners and elected officials of Augusta County have
expressed objection to the creation of a national park.  Creating
a unit of the National Park System through fee simple acquisition
and/or purchase of easements on this much land with this many
land owners would be complex, controversial, and long-term. 
<p>
Third, acquisition costs for the battlefield areas, which are
large cultural landscapes, would be high.  While fee acquisition
might not be necessary in every case, since many of the
battlefields can be appreciated through a driving tour with some
minimal access, easements or other preservation measures would be
necessary in order to ensure continued compatible use at sites
with high integrity.  Without these easements, the integrity
losses experienced now in the Winchester and Front Royal areas
would be repeated in time over much of the Valley.
<p>
Fourth, the management structure for interpretation,
preservation, and administration of a battlefield park of
discontiguous areas could not be as efficient as a single,
contiguous unit, due to the distance between areas and the number
of local governments.  This model would be even more complex,
given the much greater distance and lack of a protected unifying
resource (such as a river, canal or other land-based resource)
over the length of the region.
<p>
Finally, the size of Federal holdings in the region and State
should be considered.  The Shenandoah National Park, Blue Ridge
Parkway, and George Washington National Forest encompass many
thousands of acres along both sides of the Valley.  While these
land holdings offer many benefits to local residents in terms of
watershed and viewshed protection, recreational opportunities,
and tourist attractions, there may be strong local resistance
against further expansion of significantly large Federal holdings
in some areas of the region.  Acquiring parcels of high integrity
of all of the Valley's battlefields could conceivably add 10,000
- 30,000 acres of battlefield land to the Federal holdings in the
State. 
<p>
In summary, it appears this alternative does not meet feasibility
criteria based on the size, configuration, complexity and
diversity of ownership and community sentiments, and costs
necessary to acquire and administer a park of this size and
discontiguous configuration. 
<p>
<b>Cost Estimates for Preservation Alternatives</b>
<p>
National Park Service policy generally is not to provide cost
estimates for alternatives that do not meet all criteria for
inclusion in the National Park System, or where insufficient
information precludes making firm assessments.  Nevertheless, in
response to comments on the draft report, rough cost estimates of
non-acquisition activities associated with the alternatives are
offerred; there were insufficient study funds available to
estimate acquisition costs for each alternative.
<p>
Although the more feasible alternatives presented in this study
stress cooperation between Federal and non-Federal entities,
information gathered during this study, in particular comments
from local governments and organizations in the Valley, strongly
indicates that Federal monies will represent the major funding
source for each of the alternatives.  State and local in-kind
services, local legislation, and private cooperative efforts
represent a more realistic, non-Federal contribution than
funding. 
<p>
Cost estimates presented in this study, which are exclusive of
acquisition costs, are for purposes of generally comparing the
alternatives, they are not meant to be firm predictions of the
costs of implementing the alternatives.  
<p>
Technical assistance activities appear in Alternatives II, III
and IV.  Costs for these activities may not differ significantly
between these alternatives.  Costs for Alternative III may
feasibly be less than Alternative II because affiliated area
status assumes a level of protection has already been achieved. 
Alternatives IV and V represent the most expensive long term
preservation alternatives because planning and operating expenses
of NPS units represent a Federal expense not required in
Alternatives I-III.
