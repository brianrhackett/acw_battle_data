<H2>9. Private Ownership, Preservation, and Public Access</H2><p>
<p>
Most of the battlefield land in the Valley is privately owned. 
Only two battlefields offer public access with interpretive
facilities for visitors: New Market and Cedar Creek.  Two
hundred-eighty acres of the core area of the New Market
battlefield are encompassed by the New Market Battlefield Park,
owned and interpreted by the Virginia Military Institute.  The
National Trust and the Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation jointly
administer about 400 acres of Belle Grove Mansion and the Cedar
Creek battlefield core.  The recently opened Hupp's Hill
Battlefield Park and Study Center, also at Cedar Creek,
interprets the role of the Valley in the Civil War and also
preserves sections of reconstructed and original fieldworks on
the property.<p>
<p>
Limited public access to several other sites is provided by
preservation groups that own battlefield land.  A private, non-
profit preservation organization, the Association for the
Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), holds 195 acres at
Fisher's Hill, 7 acres at Port Republic, and more than 100 acres
at McDowell.  The private, non-profit Lee-Jackson Foundation owns
100 acres at Cross Keys and an additional 100 acres at McDowell,
adjacent to the APCWS property.  These groups allow public access
to their properties, but entry points are neither marked nor
advertised.  This situation typically limits visitation of these
properties to the organizations' members or to serious students
of the war who come as part of a guided tour.  Bus tours of the
Shenandoah Valley battlefields are conducted periodically by the
Smithsonian Institute, by Civil War Roundtables, and by the
APCWS.  Interpretation at these sites ranges from none to
minimal.<p>
<p>
About 170 acres of the First Kernstown core area are held by the
Glen Burnie Trust, but access to this land is restricted. 
Twenty-one acres of the Tom's Brook battlefield core are
encompassed by a county recreational park, but no interpretation
of the battle is offered, and the site lacks a suitable vantage
point from which to interpret the battle action.  Seven acres
surrounding the significant Civil War fortification, Star Fort,
in Winchester, are owned by a private Civil War reenactment
group, and visitation of this unmarked site is encouraged.  Holy
Cross Abbey owns two-thirds of the core area of Cool Spring
battlefield and has pledged to preserve the property.  The Abbey
allows visitation with prior arrangement.  At Piedmont, the
northern half of the core area has been included in an
agricultural preservation district that excludes non-agricultural
development for seven years until 1998, when the district must be
renewed.  Visitation of this site is typically restricted to the
public roads and an adequate driving tour of the area has not
been published.  A small portion of Cedar Creek and Fisher's Hill
battlefields falls within holdings of the Shenandoah National
Forest.  <a href="svsfig6.html">Figure 6</a> summarizes
the current state of public access, private ownership, and land
protection.<p>
<p>
Beyond these holdings and commitments, the remainder of the
acreage of the Shenandoah Valley's battlefields is privately
owned and unprotected by any formal designation or commitment. 
Access to private property at these sites is understandably
discouraged under current arrangements.  Local landowners
repeatedly expressed their anger over relic hunters who
trespassed and left a gate open for livestock to escape or a
field full of unfilled holes.  Landowners do not like to spend
extra time keeping track of trespassers.<p>
<p>
Many of the Valley's battlefields could be adequately interpreted
from the public roads if interpretive materials were produced and
disseminated.  Some limited access to private property would
certainly enhance the experience of visiting the battlefield in
many cases and serve to attract more visitors.<p>
<p>
Public access to battlefields is a complex issue that can be
resolved only by negotiation between a responsible agent and
private landowners.  Landowners wish to maintain their privacy
and security.  Many, however, would allow limited or scheduled
access to their property if concerns over liability and related
matters could be resolved.  In some cases, right-of-way easements
could be purchased to allow visitors to follow a hiking trail
across portions of a battlefield or to reach a vantage point from
where the field could be studied.  There are precedents for
granting this type of access for hiking and nature trails in
other States, notably Vermont, where landowners have expressed
satisfaction with the Trails for Vermont program.  Virginia law
waives liability for persons who allow fox hunters on their
property.  These and other models could be studied for their
applicability to Civil War battlefields.  The more of these
arrangements that can be contracted, the less need there may be
at some sites for preservation interests to acquire land or
easements to protect and interpret a battlefield.  Federal and
State governments could develop incentives to encourage landowner
cooperation.<p>
<p>
There is certainly a national constituency for battlefield
landscape preservation.  Based on comments received on the draft
of this report, the local governments of Frederick and Highland
Counties and the City of Winchester, as well as private
preservation groups, would support the creation of a park at one
or more sites in the Shenandoah Valley.  <p>
<p>
<B>It is the strong recommendation of the study team that
whatever approach to preservation is taken, that local residents
and elected officials be included as partners in the process, and
that any land acquisition be from willing sellers.</B>
