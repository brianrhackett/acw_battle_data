<H2>10. Summary</H2>
<p><p>
The decision to protect battlefield land and the decision of how
much of a battlefield to set aside, are choices that hinge upon
the community's goals as well as the Nation's.  Where the concern
was simply to recall an event to memory, then small parcels were
typically set aside for the erection of a monument or
interpretive markers.  
<p><p>
This approach was pursued often in the past, even for national
parks, based on the ``implicit preservation'' of open land.  In
other words, an interpretive stop or trail was acquired and
markers erected to describe the historical importance of what was
expected to be rural landscape for the foreseeable future. 
Visitors to such sites often assumed that the landscape was
somehow protected, when in actuality, the view was a bonus. 
Returning years later, they are liable to be surprised and
disturbed to see a housing subdivision or commercial strip where
they expected to see a battlefield.  
<p><p>
In fact, some residential developers have reversed the ``free
bonus'' and can now charge top dollar for homes with a park in
the back yard to serve the recreational needs of a limited number
of residents.  The assumptions underlying small parcel-
commemoration have been undermined on all sides, and this
condition will continue to generate crisis after crisis, as
constituents recognize and respond with outrage to the loss of
historic resources.
<p><p>
The most dramatic example of public outrage in recent years was
the crusade to prevent a shopping mall from being built adjacent
to Manassas National Battlefield Park, resulting in a costly
Federal acquisition.  But this is only one incident of many.  The
famous Cornfield at Antietam was only recently protected from
development by a private foundation.  A half mile-long,
``commemorative'' strip of the Wilderness was recently degraded
to serve as the median strip of a four-lane access road leading
to a resort community.  A thousand homes and a shopping center
are planned for parcels adjacent to Gettysburg National Military
Park.  With the increased pace of land use change, the small
parcel approach simply does not protect the resources and land
where historically important events took place, nor does it allow
adequate public access to enable appreciation of nationally
significant events.
<p><p>
Whether the goals of battlefield preservation are to enable
interpretation of the battlefield, in terms of understanding the
terrain and military maneuvers, or, to attract visitors who are
interested in experiencing a past event, or, to provide the
opportunity for the general public to view locations important to
our national experience and history, or, to set aside ground, as
President Lincoln stated, that was consecrated by the men who
struggled there to give life to the nation, it is clear that
small parcel-commemoration is inadequate and should be abandoned
except as a last resort, when it is necessary to prevent the
memory of an event and its participants from fading entirely. 
The commitment to protect large tracts of battlefield land, on
the other hand, implies a larger desire in the community to
preserve open land for a variety of reasons--not just for
historical significance--but also to maintain the rural character
of an area, to encourage agriculture, to set aside natural areas,
to protect watersheds, to provide recreational space, or to
provide a historic attraction that is unique to the area.  
<p><p>
Until now the preservation of battlefields in the Shenandoah
Valley has depended almost exclusively on the small parcel-
commemorative approach, in many cases, consisting simply of
interpretive highway pull-offs along the right-of-way.  Several
private groups--primarily the Virginia Military Institute, the
Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites, the Cedar
Creek Battlefield Foundation, and the Lee-Jackson
Foundation--have acted to protect larger parcels through
acquisition funded by public donations.  
<p><p>
Mostly, preservation has relied upon the free bonus of open farm
and natural lands and the coincidence of interests between
landowners and preservationists--as shown by the establishment of
the Piedmont agricultural preservation district and the
preservation intent of the Holy Cross Abbey at Cool Spring.  The
pace of growth and development in the Valley and the incremental
loss of farmland are undermining these assumptions of ``implicit
preservation.''  Individuals, who have shouldered the burden of
preservation with little help or recognition from Local, State,
or Federal governments, cannot keep pace with the loss of
resources.
<p><p>
It remains then to determine approaches to battlefield protection
that will preserve these historic resources and landscapes.  The
regional coordination of preservation and interpretation efforts,
and a range of public and public-private partnerships, will be
needed to address the unique needs and values of the individual
sites.  There is no blanket solution.  In the sections that
follow, we try to provide sufficient facts and analysis to inform
the public policy choices that need to be made.
