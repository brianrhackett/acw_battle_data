<h2>1. ``The Crossroads of Our Being...''</h2>
<p><p>
Into little more than four years, from April 1861 to June 1865,
were compressed the passions, the violence, the hopes, and the
agonies of generations.  More than 600,000 American soldiers of
North and South died of battle or disease.  Nearly 300,000 others
were scarred by shot and shell but lived to return home at war's
end, to begin their lives anew in a country now indissolubly
united.  The American Civil War, in the words of historian Shelby
Foote, ``was the crossroads of our being.'' Former Poet Laureate
of the United States Robert Penn Warren once wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
The Civil War is, for the American imagination, the great single
event of our history.  Without too much wrenching, it may, in
fact, be said to be American history.  Before the Civil War we
had no history in the deepest and most inward sense.  There was,
of course, the noble vision of the Founding Fathers articulated
in the Declaration and the Constitution--the dream of freedom
incarnated in a more perfect Union.  But the Revolution did not
create a nation except on paper; and too often in the following
years the vision of the Founding Fathers, which men had suffered
and died to validate, became merely a daydream of easy and
automatic victories, a vulgar delusion of manifest destiny, a
conviction of a people divinely chosen to live on milk and honey
at small expense.  The vision had not been finally submitted to
the test of history.  There was little awareness of the cost of
having a history.  The anguished scrutiny of the meaning of the
vision in experience had not become a national reality.  It
became a reality, and we became a nation, only with the Civil
War.  The Civil War is our only ``felt'' history--history lived
in the national imagination.  This is not to say that the War is
always, and by all men, felt in the same way.  Quite the
contrary.  But this fact is an index to the very complexity,
depth, and fundamental significance of the event.  It is an
overwhelming and vital image of human and national experience.
</blockquote>
<p>
Fully one-third of the recorded events of armed conflict of the
Civil War occurred in Virginia, where the proximity of
Washington, D.C., and Richmond--capitals of the opposed
camps--spurred campaign after campaign.  The passing of the
armies in Virginia left an indelible impression upon the American
cultural landscape, endowing posterity with the resonance of such
names as Manassas and Bull Run, Malvern Hill, Chancellorsville,
Fredericksburg, Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor,
Petersburg--and others less well rehearsed--Seven Pines, Gaines'
Mill, Cedar Run, Chantilly, North Anna, and Yellow Tavern.
<p><p>
Few places associated with the Civil War in Virginia evoke more
recognition or response among students of the time than the
Shenandoah Valley, where a Southern VMI professor-turned-general
named Thomas J. Jackson defeated three Northern armies in a
single month.  The battles of Jackson's Valley Campaign of 1862
are known to students of the war, not only in the United States,
but across the world.  General Norman Schwarzkopf recently
credited Jackson's campaign in a televised interview as one of
the guiding lights behind his strategy in the Middle East.  Field
Marshal Erwin Rommel, the ``Desert Fox,'' is said to have been
well versed in Stonewall's maxims, and an apocryphal story has
Rommel visiting the Valley and following in Jackson's footsteps. 
To this day, the U.S. Army regularly conducts ``staff rides'' in
the Valley for its officers, following the course of Jackson's
famed ``Foot Cavalry.''<p>
<p>
Less romantic, less well known than the 1862 campaign, but no
less significant, were the events of the war's later years as the
North tried to exorcise the ghost of Jackson and gain control of
the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia's most important agricultural
region. The war acquired a dark and desperate edge. In October
1864, Union general Philip Sheridan introduced total warfare to
the Valley, a concept that Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman
introduced in Mississippi and would bring to Georgia in November
and December, during his ``March to the Sea.'' In Sheridan's
words: ``I have destroyed over 2,000 barns, filled with wheat,
hay, and farming implements; over 70 mills, filled with flour and
wheat....   When this is completed, the Valley from Winchester up
to Staunton, ninety-two miles, will have but little in it for man
or beast.'' This bitter month became known to Valley residents as
``The Burning.''<p>
<p>
Few regions in the United States have experienced the horrors of
systematic destruction, and the memories are still close to the
surface for many long-time Valley residents.  Family histories
are filled with stories that relate to the hardships of that
time.  It took a generation to repair the ravages of ``The
Burning'' and another generation before life in the Valley
returned to its pre-war condition.  There can be found there
today a fierce pride in ancestors who survived the war and who
struggled to rebuild all that was lost.
<p><p>
Official chronologies record 326 incidents of armed conflict in
the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War: 6 battles, 21
engagements, 21 actions, and 278 skirmishes, on the average one
conflict every 4-5 days (see <a href="svsfig7.html">Figure
7</a>).  This reckoning does not include many of the raids,
ambushes, and partisan affairs that made warfare in the Valley a
daily dance with death.  More than half of the recorded armed
conflicts occurred in the final year of the war.  Map 6 shows how
these events plot out in terms of frequency with the reddest
areas showing most frequent fighting and the bluest areas showing
least frequent fighting.<p>
<p>
The total numbers of killed and wounded in these conflicts has
never been tallied, nor do the records exist to allow it. 
Thousands more died in hospitals of disease than in battle.  The
Confederate and National cemeteries at Winchester alone account
for nearly 7,500 dead, and it is difficult to locate a city or
private cemetery in the Valley that does not comment silently on
the commitment and valor of the Valley's soldiers.
<p><p>
The history of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley bears
witness to the devastation and waste of warfare, but more
importantly, it underscores the irrepressible human will to
survive, to rebuild, to carry on.  Lessons which will continue to
have relevance for generations to come.  The historic events and
the human players of the Valley--the heroic and the tragic
alike--have contributed significantly to the texture of our
American cultural heritage.
