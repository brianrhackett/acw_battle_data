<p>
<B>Campaign:</B> Jackson's Valley Campaign<p>
<B>Principal Commanders:</B> [c] Maj. Gen. <a
href="jackson.gif">T. J. ``Stonewall'' Jackson</a>; [u] Brig.
Gen. <a href="ebtyler.gif">E. B. Tyler</a><p>
<B>Forces Engaged:</B> [c] Jackson's and Ewell's divisions, about
6,000 engaged; [u] Two brigades of Shields's division (Tyler and
Carroll), about 3,500<p> 
<B>Casualties:</B> [c] 816 (88k/535w/34m); [u] 1,002
(67k/361w/574m&c)<p>
<p>
<B>Significance:</B> The battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic
were the culmination of ``Stonewall'' Jackson's Valley Campaign
in which Jackson maneuvered to defeat superior Union forces by
surprise, swift marching, and concentration of force.  In May and
June, Jackson's Army of the Valley, which never exceeded 17,000
men, inflicted more than 7,000 casualties on his opponents at a
cost of only 2,500 of his own men, and tied up Union forces three
times its strength.  Jackson's victories infused new hope in the
Confederate cause and contributed to the defeat of McClellan's
campaign against Richmond.   The battle of Port Republic was a
fierce contest between two equally determined foes and was the
most costly battle fought by the Army of the Valley during its
campaign.  At its conclusion, Union forces withdrew down the
Valley, freeing Jackson's command to go to the aid of the CS army
facing Maj. Gen. George McClellan's army in front of Richmond.<p>

<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  Dispositions of the Armies:</B> During the night
of 8-9 June 1862, Winder's ``Stonewall'' Brigade was withdrawn
from its forward position near Bogota and rejoined Jackson's
division at Port Republic.  CS pioneers built a bridge of wagons
across the South River at Port Republic.  Winder's brigade was
assigned the task of spearheading the assault against US forces
south of the river.  Trimble's brigade and elements of Patton's
were left to delay Fr‚mont's forces at Cross Keys, while the rest
of Ewell's division marched to Port Republic to be in position to
support Winder's attack. 
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  US Deployment:</B> Brig. Gen. E. B. Tyler's
brigade joined Col. Samuel Carroll's brigade north of Lewiston on
the Luray Road. The rest of Shields's division was strung out
along the muddy roads back to Luray.  General Tyler, in command
on the field, advanced at dawn of 9 June to the vicinity of
Lewiston.  He anchored the left of his line on a battery
positioned on the Lewiston Coaling, extending his infantry west
along Lewiston Lane (present day rte. 708) to the South Fork near
the site of Lewis' Mill.  The right and center were supported by
artillery (16 guns in all).
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  CS Advance on the Left and Center:</B> Winder's
brigade crossed the river by 0500 hours and deployed to attack
east across the bottomland.  Winder sent two regiments (2VA and
4VA) into the woods to flank the US line and assault the Coaling.
When the main CS battle line advanced, it came under heavy fire
from the US artillery and was soon pinned down.  CS batteries
were brought forward onto the plain but were outgunned and forced
to seek safer positions.  Ewell's brigades were hurried forward
to cross the river.  Seeing the strength of the US artillery at
the Coaling, Jackson sent Taylor's brigade to the right into the
woods to support the flanking column that was attempting to
advance through the thick underbrush.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  US Counterattack:</B> Winder's brigade renewed
its assault on the US right and center, taking heavy casualties. 
General Tyler moved two regiments from the Coaling to his right
and launched a counterattack, driving CS forces back nearly half
a mile.  While this was occurring, the first CS regiments probed
the defenses of the Coaling but were repulsed.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.  Fighting at the Coaling:</B> Finding resistance
more fierce than anticipated, Jackson ordered the last of Ewell's
forces still north of Port Republic to cross the rivers and burn
the North Fork bridge.  These reinforcements began to reach
Winder, strengthening his line and stopping the US counterattack.

Taylor's brigade reached a position in the woods across from the
Coaling and launched a fierce attack, which carried the hill,
capturing five guns.  Tyler immediately responded with a
counterattack, using his reserves.  These regiments, in hand-to-
hand fighting, retook the position.  Taylor shifted a regiment to
the far right to outflank the US battle line.  The CS attack
again surged forward to capture the Coaling.  Five captured guns
were turned against the rest of the Union line.  With the loss of
the Coaling, the Union position along Lewiston Lane became
untenable, and Tyler ordered a withdrawal about 1030 hours. 
Jackson ordered a general advance.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Six.  Tyler's Retreat/Fr‚mont's Advance:</B>
Taliaferro's fresh CS brigade arrived from Port Republic and
pressed the retreating Federals for several miles north along the
Luray Road, taking several hundred prisoners.  The Confederate
army was left in possession of the field.  Shortly after noon,
Fr‚mont's army began to deploy on the north bank of the South
Fork, too late to aid Tyler's defeated command.  Fr‚mont deployed
artillery on the high bluffs to harass the CS forces.  Jackson
gradually withdrew along a narrow road through the woods and
concentrated his army in the vicinity of Mt. Vernon Furnace. 
Jackson expected Fr‚mont to cross the river and attack him on the
following day, but during the night Fr‚mont withdrew toward
Harrisonburg.

<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The setting of Port Republic battlefield, along the South Fork
Shenandoah River at the base of the forested Blue Ridge, is very
scenic.  From some locations the base of Massanutten Mountain can
be seen to the north.  The core of the battlefield of Port
Republic extends from the village of Port Republic east to rte.
708, which approximately traces the main US battle line.  The old
Luray-Port Republic Road followed rte. 955 north from the village
until joining present day US 340.  (US 340 south of this
intersection is not historic.) The ford over South River where
Jackson built his ``wagon bridge'' is located just west of the
confluence of the South and North rivers and can be reached by a
dirt road off rte. 955.  The North River bridge was at the end of
rte. 1601.  Fr‚mont's batteries were deployed along the north
bank of the South Fork, south of Lawyer's Road, in the battle's
last phase.
<p><p>
The main CS assaults of General Winder were carried out on the
bottomland between rtes. 955, 708, and the river.  The land
remains agricultural and retains a strong similarity to its Civil
War appearance, except for the railroad which was not there at
the time of the battle (built 1892).  The railroad artificially
divides the battlefield but does not particularly intrude upon
most viewsheds.
<p><p>
The Coaling, which was the key to the US defense, is located just
northeast of the intersection of US 340 and rte. 708.  The
Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS) owns
about 8 acres of the Coaling, acquired from the Lee-Jackson
Foundation.  An 1880s house sits atop the Coaling where US
batteries were deployed.  Access to this property is encouraged
but unmarked.
<p><p>
The village of Port Republic is listed as a historic district in
the National Register.  Several historic structures remain in the
area, including Lynnwood, Bogota, Frank Kemper House in Port
Republic, and others.  The Dr. Kemper house at the west edge of
town, which served as Jackson's headquarters, is no longer
extant.  The ruin of Mt. Vernon Furnace in the area where
Jackson's army bivouacked after the battle is situated in
Shenandoah National Park along rte. 659.  A driving tour of Port
Republic could be laid out to view the battlefield with stops at
the village, at the railroad (rte. 708), and the Coaling. 
Because of the terrain, Port Republic can be interpreted from
public roads.  The portion of the Coaling preserved by APCWS
allows an expanded interpretation of the battle.  The areas of
major infantry fighting along the river are in private hands, but
the logic of the respective positions can be understood for the
most part from public roads.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to the Battlefield:</H2>
<p><p>
The bottomland south of the South Fork in the core area of the
battlefield is owned by two or three large landowners.  Several
years ago the county denied one of the landowners a petition to
establish a gravel quarry, partly because of concerns for
maintaining battlefield integrity.  Continuing integrity of the
landscape is dependent upon landowners continuing to farm their
properties.
