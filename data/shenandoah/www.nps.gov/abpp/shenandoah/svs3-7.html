<p>
<B>Significance:</B> After the Battle of Brandy Station (9 June
1863), Gen. Robert E. Lee launched his plan for a second invasion
of the north.  He ordered the Second Corps, Army of Northern
Virginia, under Maj. Gen. Richard Ewell to attack the US force at
Winchester and clear the Lower Valley of Union opposition.  In
the resulting three-day battle (13-15 June), Ewell's corps
defeated, routed, and nearly destroyed a US division under Maj.
Gen. Robert Milroy.  This victory (the apogee of Ewell's career)
offered high hopes for the success of Lee's second invasion of
the North, hopes that were dashed on the battlefield of
Gettysburg in July.  In the words of Confederate artillerist Maj.
Robert Stiles, ``This battle of Winchester ... was one of the
most perfect pieces of work the Army of Northern Virginia ever
did.'' The battle was won by deft flanking maneuvers and
underscores the inadequacy of relying on entrenchments when
confronted by a mobile attacking force.
<p><p>
<hr><p><p>
<h2>Description of the Battle</h2><p>
<p>
<B>Prelude (12 June):</B> On 12 June 1863, the Second Corps of
the Army of Northern Virginia under Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell,
three divisions nearly 19,000 strong, entered the Valley at
Chester Gap and pressed on to Front Royal.  Two divisions under
Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early and Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson continued
north on the Valley Pike and the Front Royal Road to converge on
the Union defenders of Winchester under Maj. Gen. Robert Milroy. 
Despite the superior forces that were rumored to be approaching,
Milroy was confident that the strength of his fortifications
would enable him to repel the Confederates or withstand a siege. 
The ridges west of town were heavily fortified and consisted of
trenches linking central strong points or ``forts''.  The
strongest of these were Fort Milroy and Star Fort.  West Fort, a
redoubt of six guns, featured prominently in the action. 
<p><p>
<B>Phase One.  US Dispositions (13 June):</B> On 13 June, Milroy
advanced elements of Elliott's brigade to Pritchard's Hill at
Kernstown and sent elements of Ely's brigade to intercept any
advance on the Front Royal Pike.  McReynolds brigade was at
Berryville.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Two.  CS Advance on Front Royal Pike (13 June):</B>
Edward Johnson's Division of four brigades (Steuart, Williams,
Walker, Jones) advanced on the Front Royal Pike driving back
Union pickets.  Approaching the intersection of Millwood Road
about 1400 hours, Johnson deployed and swept forward, driving
Union skirmishers from behind stone fences.  US troops withdrew
to high ground north of Abrams Creek under cover of a battery and
the heavy guns of Fort Milroy.  Johnson brought up a battery and
engaged Union field artillery, driving several pieces from the
field.  The CS guns lacked the range to reply to Fort Milroy's
guns and eventually were forced to withdraw.  Johnson's advance
was stalled, and he awaited the arrival of Early's division to
the west on the Valley Pike.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Three.  CS Advance on Valley Pike (13 June):</B> Early's
division of four brigades (Hays, Smith, Avery, Gordon) marched
toward Winchester on the Valley Pike in conjunction with
Johnson's division on the Front Royal Road.  Late afternoon,
Early's column reached the outskirts of Kernstown and drove back
the US skirmish line encountered at Pritchard's Hill.  US forces
retreated to Cedar Creek Grade and briefly counterattacked, but
Early extended his line to the west, out-flanking successive
Union positions.  US cavalry attacked several times up the Valley
Pike to ease pressure on the infantry.  Eventually, the Union
force retreated north of Abrams Creek under cover of the heavy
guns from Bower's Hill and Fort Milroy.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Four.  Milroy Withdraws into the Forts (13 June):</B>
After dark Milroy concentrated his forces inside a triangle
defined by Fort Milroy, Star Fort, and West Fort.  McReynolds'
brigade reached Fort Milroy after marching a round-about route
from Berryville, harassed by Confederate cavalry.  Milroy's
soldiers had fought well during the previous afternoon, and he
was confident that he could withstand renewed Confederate
assaults in the morning.  In the meantime, Ewell ordered his
third division under Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes to advance on
Martinsburg via Berryville to cut off Milroy's retreat in that
direction.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Five.  Early's Flank March (14 June):</B> At dawn of 14
June, one of Early's brigades (Gordon) swept forward to capture
Bower's Hill with little resistance.  Johnson extended his line
to the right against very light opposition; there was fitful
skirmishing in the streets of Winchester.  Early and Ewell
conferred on Bower's Hill and decided on a flanking strategy. 
Gordon's brigade and two batteries were left on Bower's Hill,
while Early led his three other brigades back to Cedar Creek
Grade, west beyond Apple Pie Ridge where it was out of view of US
fortifications, then north over Cloverdale Plantation to Walnut
Grove.  His column was accompanied by 20 guns.  While Early made
this march, Johnson advanced a line of skirmishers on the right
to occupy the Federals' attention.  The CS batteries on Bower's
Hill opened up, touching off a duel with the Union guns in Fort
Milroy.  By mid-afternoon, Early's force had gained a position
opposite West Fort on Apple Pie Ridge.  Eight guns were
positioned on the Brierly Farm northwest of the fort, while 12
guns were placed in an orchard southwest of the fort.  By this
time the field had quieted, and the US forces believed that the
Confederates had been repulsed from Winchester.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Six.  Attack on West Fort (14 June):</B> About 1800
hours, Early's artillery opened fire on West Fort.  The twenty
guns fired for 45 minutes, while Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays
stealthily advanced his Louisiana brigade through the corn and
wheat fields at the base of Apple Pie Ridge.  On command, the
brigade rushed forward across 300 yards of open fields and swept
upward into the works.  After a brief hand-to-hand struggle, US
defenders abandoned the works, retreating to Fort Milroy.  Hays
was supported in the attack by two brigades (Smith and Avery). 
Early consolidated his line on West Fort Ridge, but darkness
prevented further gains.  An artillery duel continued until long
after dark.  After the battle, Ewell christened West Fort Ridge
as ``Louisiana Heights'' in honor of Hays's brigade.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Seven. Johnson's Flank March (14-15 June):</B> Ewell
assumed that Milroy would retreat during the night and ordered
Johnson to prevent his escape by cutting the Charles Town Road. 
About 2100 hours, Johnson (with Steuart's and Williams's brigades
and 8 guns) marched north to Berryville Pike and west to Jordan
Springs Road, where he turned north toward Stephenson's Depot. 
About midnight, the Stonewall brigade disengaged and joined the
rear of the column, leaving one brigade (Jones) astride the
Berryville Pike east of town.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Eight.  US Withdrawal (14-15 June):</B> After conferring
with his officers, Milroy made the decision to try to ``cut their
way through'' to Harpers Ferry on the old Charles Town Road.  All
of the cannons were spiked and their carriages destroyed. 
Shortly after midnight, the Union soldiers left their works so
quietly that Early's Confederates did not know they were gone
until morning.  The column massed in the low ground between Star
Fort and Fort Milroy, then moved down the railroad and the Valley
Pike toward the Charles Town crossroad, just south of
Stephenson's Depot.
<p><p>
<B>Phase Nine.  US Surrender at Stephenson's Depot (15 June):</B>
Near dawn, Johnson's skirmishers encountered the head of Milroy's
retreating column near the intersection of the Valley Pike and
old Charles Town road.  Milroy faced his column to the right on
the pike and prepared to fight his way out of a ``murderous
trap.'' Johnson deployed his regiments along Milburn Road as they
came up and advanced to the railroad and placed two guns on
either side of the Charles Town Road railroad bridge.  The rest
of the artillery was deployed on the heights east of Milburn
Road.  As it grew light, US forces made several desperate but
uncoordinated attacks against the bridge and railroad embankment.
<p><p>
The Confederates were being steadily reinforced and repulsed each
attempt.  The Stonewall brigade now came up in line of battle
north of the road and advanced to cut the Valley Pike.  This was
the final blow; Union regiments hoisted the white flag.  Between
2,500 and 3,000 surrendered.  Milroy and his staff, and other
small units escaped to the west.  (Note: US casualty figures for
Second Winchester vary widely.  This is explained by the fact
that about two thousand Union soldiers not belonging to Milroy's
command were in field hospitals in the city and were often added
to the number of captured and missing.  Milroy, of course, played
down his losses.)
<p><p>
<hr><p><p>
<H2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
Contrary to popular perception, Second Winchester is not a
``lost'' battlefield.  Because of the wide-ranging Confederate
maneuvers involved, the battlefield covers a great deal of
ground, but the major fighting and casualties occurred at five
locations: Pritchard's Hill; the intersection of Millwood and
Front Royal pikes (interchange 82 of I-81); Abrams Creek and
Bower's Hill; Apple Pie Ridge and West Fort; and Stephenson's
Depot.  Three of these locations retain high levels of integrity:
Pritchard's Hill, Apple Pie Ridge and West Fort, and Stephenson's
Depot.  The parcel of ground at Pritchard's Hill figured
prominently in both battles of Kernstown and in the rear guard
actions of Opequon.  The parcel of ground at Stephenson's Depot
figured in cavalry actions during the battle of Opequon and in
the engagement of Rutherford's Farm (20 July 1864).  Although the
field over which the Louisiana Brigade attacked West Fort has
been divided by the rte. 37 bypass, the terrain is still intact
and adds to the interpretation of the battle.
<p><p>
Central to understanding the Union ring of fortifications at
Winchester are Fort Milroy, Star Fort, and West Fort.  Of these,
Star Fort is well preserved, while remnants survive of Fort
Milroy and West Fort.  Portions of related entrenchments survive
on ridges north and west of Winchester, although the extent of
survivals has not been measured.  The view from Star Fort is
essential for understanding the US position at Second Winchester.

Access to Fort Milroy and creation of a viewshed among trees
would enhance the ability to interpret the Union situation.
<p><p>
The routes of CS flanking maneuvers (Early to the west and
Johnson to the east) can be followed.  Early's route traverses
well preserved rural tracts north from Cedar Creek Grade along
Apple Pie Ridge.  The exact route can only be followed on foot
across private property.  Johnson's route crosses a portion of
the Opequon battlefield and follows rural roads past Jordan
Spring to the intersection of rtes. 761 and 11 near Stephenson. 
Much of this course is through scenic farmland, although the
density of housing along segments of these roads is increasing. 
Driving this route offers an appreciation of CS strategy and of
the final action at Stephenson's Depot.
<p><p>
Many historic structures associated with the battle remain in and
around the city of Winchester, including Taylor's Hotel which
served as the US headquarters, and Cloverdale and Walnut Grove,
which were passed by Early's flank march.
<p><p>
<H2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</H2>
<p><p>
The city of Winchester has grown up around the US defensive
position, which was anchored by West Fort, Star Fort, Fort
Milroy, and connecting entrenchments.  In most cases, however,
the ridge crests have been the last to develop as residential
tracts have filled the valleys.  As a result, Star Fort is well
preserved; portions of Fort Milroy remain; and traces of West
Fort can be located.  Recently, housing has been built along West
Fort Ridge (``Louisiana Heights'') destroying or otherwise
segmenting surviving earthworks.  The northern portion of Fort
Milroy was recently purchased for the purpose of development; the
southern portion is owned by National Fruit Products.  Seven
acres of Star Fort are owned by a local preservation group, but
the surrounding 50 acres are zoned commercial/business and are
currently for sale; portions of earthworks at Star Fort are in
need of stabilization; grounds would need to be cleared, planted
with grass, and maintained to expand visitation and
interpretation.  Commercial and industrial development along rte.
522 intrudes somewhat on the viewshed.
<p><p>
Of the five main engagement areas, Bower's Hill is a housing
subdivision and site of a high school, elementary school, and
water tower.  A degraded portion of the field (also fought over
during First Winchester) remains along railroad tracks west of US
11, but this land is scheduled for high density residential
development.  Johnson's position on June 13-14 at intersection of
Front Royal and Millwood pikes lies beneath I-81 interchange #82.
Land contours have been extensively altered and viewsheds blocked
by dense commercial/industrial development in the vicinity. 
These two segments for most interpretive activities have been
lost.
<p><p>
Pritchard's Hill is privately owned and remains in a relatively
pristine state.  The land between Pritchard's Hill and Bower's
Hill has already been densely developed for residential and
commercial purposes.  The Apple Pie Ridge-West Fort parcel across
which the Louisiana brigade attacked West Fort is bisected by
rte. 37-bypass but is visually well preserved, maintained as
pasture and apple orchards.  Two historic stone houses survive
adjacent to the highway, which runs through a ravine and is not
particularly intrusive to the view from Apple Pie Ridge.  An
excellent vantage point for understanding this phase exists just
south of the intersection of rtes. 522 and 679.
<p><p>
The area south of Stephenson's Depot, site of the massive US
surrender, is by far the best preserved parcel of Second
Winchester.  Except for power lines and towers, the land retains
its Civil War appearance.  This parcel covers much of the ground
where the battle culminated, where the most desperate fighting
occurred, and where nearly 3,000 Union soldiers surrendered; its
significance should not be underestimated.  The parcel is owned
by a local developer, but is not currently serviced by sewage
lines.
