<H2>4. Threat Assessment</H2>
<p><p>
From a ranking of the battlefields in terms of acreage, forces
engaged, casualties, and fatalities, we turn to an assessment of
the threats to each site.  In Part Three, the perceived threats
to each site were described in some detail.  In this section we
rank the sites in terms of relative threats and try to provide a
sense of the time frame within which preservation activities must
proceed.  It is a tight schedule for many of the sites, which are
in danger of slipping from poor to lost or from fair to poor
condition within the next few years.  If the current building
recession continues, the fate of these sites may be prolonged for
a few more years but not indefinitely.  Many developers have
placed their plans on hold, waiting to see how the market will
develop.  Land prices have declined somewhat in the high growth
zones.  Several battlefield parcels have been auctioned off for
bankruptcy.  In this climate, local governments seem more willing
to consider alternative development scenarios, which include
preserving battlefield sites in order to strengthen the tourism
sector.  If economic boom times return, however--and no
preservation efforts have occurred in the meantime--then the
integrity of many of the Valley's battlefields will decline
rapidly, following the downward trend described below.
<p><p>
The assessment of threats to integrity was derived from a
combination of factors, primarily the current integrity of the
site, the number of landowners, known threats to specific core
and study area parcels, current zoning (if any), the rate of
population growth, and the amount of recent land use change in
the vicinity.  The threats assessment is meant to extrapolate
from current trends and cannot be expected to foresee
``catastrophic,'' that is, sudden and unexpected change.
<p>
In reality, someone could decide tomorrow to build a large
residential subdivision in the heart of Piedmont or Cross Keys
battlefields, but this would not be likely.  Such a subdivision
would be outside of Harrisonburg's current building zone and
would presumably be unprofitable in the near future.  The number
of landowners would make a large development more difficult to
assemble.  The high integrity of both sites would tend to stand
up longer against incremental land use change.  Agriculture is
still strong and viable in the vicinity, allowing farmers to hold
on to their land and continue their livelihood.  Opequon
battlefield, on the other hand, is in poor condition; it is in
the heart of Winchester's high growth area; it is zoned for
residential development; remaining core parcels are owned by
fewer landowners, several of whom have plans for development; and
several core parcels have recently been for sale.  It is not
difficult to predict the imminent loss of this battlefield's
remaining resources without an immediate and strenuous effort to
preserve them.
<p><p>
Five threat levels were assigned--very high, high, moderate, low,
and very low--and these are defined below:
<p><p>
<b>1. Very High:</b> Rapidly changing land use in study area,
core parcels immediately threatened, battlefield highly
fragmented by large parcels of lost integrity, imminent loss of
remaining resources.
<p><p>
<b>2. High:</b> Rapidly changing land use in study area, large
core parcels threatened, portions of battlefield already lost,
substantial loss of resources within ten years.
<p><p>
<b>3. Moderate:</b> Incremental change of land use in study area,
battlefield largely intact with small core parcels lost or
threatened, some resource loss within ten years probable.
<p><p>
<b>4. Low:</b> Land use in study area changing slowly, core
parcels as yet unthreatened, battlefield intact, some resource
loss within ten years possible.
<p><p>
<b>5. Very Low:</b> Land use in study area has not changed, core
parcels preserved, battlefield intact, loss of resources within
ten years improbable.
<p><p>
<a href="svsfig17.html">Figure 17 summarizes levels of threat</a>
for the fifteen battlefields.  The threats to three sites --First
Winchester, Opequon, and Front Royal-- are considered very high. 
Threats to four sites --First and Second Kernstown, Second
Winchester, and Tom's Brook-- are rated high.  New Market,
Fisher's Hill, Cedar Creek and Cool Spring are moderately
threatened.  Piedmont, Cross Keys, and Port Republic are
experiencing low levels of threat, and McDowell, very low.
<p><p>
It can be seen that, in the absence of preservation efforts, the
only battlefield that appears entirely secure within the
foreseeable future is McDowell.  Only McDowell is not
significantly threatened by any form of land use change.  The
principal source of threats for all sites comes from expansion of
residential development followed, in declining order of
incidence, by commercial, highway, and industrial developments. 
Residential construction threatens twelve battlefields,
commercial development threatens seven, highway construction
threatens six, industrial and quarrying development threatens
three.
