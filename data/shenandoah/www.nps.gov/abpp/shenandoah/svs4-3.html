<H2>3. Relative Importance of the Battlefields</H2>
<p>
The study team was asked to prioritize the battlefields of the
Shenandoah Valley in terms of their significance.  There is no
easy way to arrive at such an assessment through historical
analysis alone.  The richest understanding of individual major
battles within the Valley is best achieved by viewing the
battlefields together, in their interaction with one another
within a campaign context. The battle events are so
interdependent, due to geography and topography, that to consider
one battlefield separately from those of which it is a part, is
to miss a critical meaning of this unique aspect of the Civil
War.  How Stonewall Jackson manipulated these geographic
realities remains a source of continuing fascination for military
strategists. Viewed individually, Jackson's 1862 battles are
dwarfed by the larger 1864 conflicts at Opequon and Cedar Creek.
Yet Jackson's successful campaign profoundly shaped the early
conduct of the war when the hopes of the Confederacy were high
and its armies in the East seemed almost invincible.  Jackson's
campaign contributed materially to the defeat of Union armies in
the Seven Days' Battles before Richmond by diverting large
numbers of troops to protect Washington, D.C.  Prioritizing by
size, forces engaged, or casualties alone will not reflect
adequately the significance of the individual events.
<p><p>
National Historic Landmark criteria are used by the National Park
Service to evaluate cultural properties that possess exceptional
value or quality in illustrating or interpreting our heritage,
and that possess a high degree of integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.  The
following National Historic Landmark significance criteria apply
to the Civil War sites in the Shenandoah Valley.  A complete
version of National Historic Landmark significance and integrity
criteria may be found in Federal Regulations 36 CFR Part 65.
<p><p>
Battlefields that would meet the Landmark criteria are sites:

<blockquote>
That are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to, and are identified with, or that outstandingly
represent, the broad national patterns of United States history
and from which an understanding and appreciation of those
patterns may be gained (Criterion 1); or
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
That are associated importantly with the lives of persons
nationally significant in the history of the United States
(Criterion 2); or 
</blockquote>
<p><p>
<blockquote>
That represent a significant, distinctive and exceptional entity
whose components may lack individual distinction (Criterion 4).
</blockquote>
<p><p>
When applied to Stonewall Jackson's 1862 Campaign, the above
National Historic Landmark criteria stand up well.  The
battlefields of the Jackson campaign--First Kernstown, McDowell,
Cross Keys, and Port Republic --are well documented as
outstanding examples of the military strategy of Stonewall
Jackson.  These battlefields retain high integrity, the latter
three being among the best preserved battlefields in the Valley. 
The battlefields of First Winchester and Front Royal may no
longer meet the criteria for integrity and would not be eligible
for Landmark status.
<p><p>
A case can be made for the national significance of Second
Winchester within the context of the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863.

The battle was not decisive in the campaign, yet the crushing
victory achieved there may well have contributed to the aura of
invincibility that the Confederate army carried with it to
Gettysburg.  This battlefield should be considered a valuable,
supporting resource for understanding and interpreting the
Gettysburg Campaign.
<p><p>
Turning to the 1864 Lynchburg campaigns of Sigel and Hunter, the
national significance of the representative battlefields--New
Market and Piedmont--is evident when viewed in context of General
Grant's Overland Campaign.  New Market Battlefield is currently
listed in the National Register of Historic Places to commemorate
the role of the Virginia Military Institute cadets and alumni in
the battle.  It also represents a failed attempt to accomplish
what Union forces were able to do a month later at Piedmont. 
Piedmont ranks among the three bloodiest battles of the Valley,
yet it is modest in size when compared to other major battles of
the Civil War.  Its significance within the context of Valley and
Virginia warfare has been underrated, however.  The Confederate
defeat at Piedmont allowed General Hunter's army to penetrate as
far as Lynchburg for the first time during the war and forced
General Lee to detach nearly a third of his army to deal with
this threat, materially influencing the direction of the
campaigns for Richmond and Petersburg. 
<p><p>
Early's and Sheridan's 1864 Valley campaigns initiated the
largest and most costly events, in terms of casualties, forces
engaged, and frequency of combat, in the history of Valley
warfare. Early's invasion of Maryland, Union defeats at Cool
Spring and Second Kernstown, and the subsequent burning of
Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, by Confederate raiders, led directly
to the appointment of Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan as overall
commander of the Union armies in the Valley.  Sheridan fielded
the largest Union fighting force--the Army of the Shenandoah--to
act in concert in the Valley. Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early, who
learned his art at Stonewall Jackson's feet, conducted a
masterful campaign with fewer men and resources than Jackson and
came close to defeating Sheridan's much larger army at Opequon
and again at Cedar Creek.  Union successes at Opequon and
Fisher's Hill led to ``The Burning.'' 
<p><p>
Indeed, the scope, size, and casualties of the battles of <a
href="svs3-12.html">Opequon</a> and <a href="svs3-15.html">Cedar Creek</a> 
would rank in any list of significant battlefields of
the Civil War.  A strong case can be made that either or both of
these battlefields can be considered nationally significant in
their own right, although the campaign context offers the
strongest evidence of significance.  Cedar Creek Battlefield
already is designated a National Historic Landmark and has
retained a high degree of integrity, while Opequon has gone
unrecognized, has deteriorated, and faces further fragmentation
in the immediate future. Taken together, the battlefields of the
Early-Sheridan campaigns--Cool Spring, Second Kernstown, Opequon,
Fisher's Hill, Tom's Brook, and Cedar Creek--represent a unique
and nationally significant chapter in the history of the Civil
War.
<p><p>
Collectively, thirteen battlefields appear to meet National
Historic Landmark criteria, excluding Front Royal and First
Winchester.  Of the largest Valley battlefields, Cedar Creek is
already designated a National Historic Landmark, and Opequon
might qualify on its own for National Historic Landmark
designation, pending a full assessment of integrity.  Both of
these battlefields represent the same campaign but neither site
tells the whole story of its campaign.  The ability of other
battlefields to warrant such NHL designation individually is
problematic.  Certainly these sites appear to qualify for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.
<p><p>
The National Park System Advisory Board, after reviewing the
draft report, recommended listing all of the battlefields on the
National Register.  Review of this report by the Board was
required under the legislation authorizing this report. 
Documentation prepared on these battlefields for this study, as
well as the resolution of the National Park System Advisory
Board, will be provided to the Virginia State Historic
Preservation Officer to initiate the nomination process.  Since
listing in the National Register of Historic Places usually is a
process initiated through States, and for which owners are
afforded by law the opportunity for input, this process would be
the next appropriate step in recognizing the importance of these
sites.
<p><p>
In conclusion, Jackson's 1862 Campaign is undoubtedly the most
famous and most widely studied of the Valley campaigns.  It was,
however, not the longest, nor the largest, nor the most
influential in terms of the war's outcome, nor the most costly in
terms of either men or materiel.  All of these ``laurels'' belong
to the Early-Sheridan campaigns of 1864.  Second Winchester
attains its significance within the context of the Gettysburg
Campaign of 1863, which amply demonstrates the Valley's strategic
importance as an invasion corridor into the North.  Civil War
Veterans considered Gettysburg to be the pivotal battle of the
Eastern theater, and sites associated with this campaign, such as
Second Winchester, may justifiably share its significance.  New
Market and Piedmont attain significance within the context of
Ulysses S.Grant's grand strategy to end the war by pushing his
armies forward on all fronts. 
<p><p>
No single battlefield can be singled out to represent the entire
Shenandoah Valley Civil War period, since each represents one
campaign (with the exception of the overlapping Kernstown
battlefields).  In addition, there is no clear line of historical
argument that assures a credible ranking of battlefields within
the individual campaigns, again, excepting Cedar Creek and
Opequon, which stand out as the culmination of Early's and
Sheridan's decisive confrontation.  Cross Keys and Port Republic
marked the culmination of the 1862 campaign, but Jackson's
campaign itself is the story, and each of the individual
battlefields tells but one episode.
<p><p>
<a href="svsfig16.html">Figure 16</a> summarizes the standards of
comparison that have been developed in Parts Two and Four of this
report.  These rankings, combined with levels of threat and risk,
and an assessment of the preservation potential for each site,
may provide guidance for a regionally coordinated approach to
preserving and interpreting as many of the battlefields as
possible.
