<H2>4. Valley Campaigns 1861-1865</H2>
<p><p>
<B>Actions in 1861</B>
After the bombardment of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, and
President Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers, Virginia seceded
on April 17, 1861.  At once, Virginia State militia moved to
secure the railroad assets, musket factories, and the Federal
armory and arsenal at Harpers Ferry.  Although Union forces
attempted to burn the facilities, most of the rifle-musket
manufacturing equipment was salvaged and shipped south to bolster
the Confederate ordnance effort.  Former VMI professor Thomas J.
Jackson assumed command of a newly formed brigade at Harpers
Ferry in the spring and moved to consolidate Confederate strength
in the area.  In July 1861, Confederate reinforcements traveled
from the Shenandoah Valley to Manassas Junction on the Manassas
Gap Railroad to reach the fighting at Bull Run, marking the first
time in modern warfare that troops were moved by train to a
battlefield.  On the battlefield of Manassas, Jackson earned the
sobriquet ``Stonewall.'' 
<p><p>
Although the remainder of the year saw sporadic skirmishing and
an engagement at Falling Waters along the Potomac River, most of
the fighting during the summer and fall of 1861 occurred farther
to the west.  During this time, Confederate forces gradually lost
political and military control of the counties that would later
be incorporated into the new state of West Virginia.  In winter
1861-1862, Jackson conducted a campaign against Union forces at
Romney, West Virginia.  
<p><p>
<B>Jackson's Valley Campaign (March-June 1862)</B>
Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's Valley Campaign of 1862 is one of
the most studied campaigns of military history.  This campaign
demonstrates how a numerically inferior force can defeat larger
forces by fast movement, surprise attack, and intelligent use of
the terrain.  In March 1862, as a Federal force under Maj. Gen.
Nathaniel Banks began to advance cautiously up the Valley,
General Jackson retreated to Mount Jackson where he could defend
the Valley Turnpike.  His task was two-fold--to prevent deep
penetration into the Valley and to tie down as many opposing
forces as possible.  When he learned that Banks was ready to
detach part of his force to assist the Army of the Potomac then
being concentrated on the Peninsula to threaten Richmond, Jackson
marched down the Turnpike and fought a battle at <a href="svs3-1.html">
Kernstown</a> on March 23.  Although defeated, Jackson's
aggressive move convinced Washington that Confederate forces in
the Valley posed a real threat to Washington, and Maj. Gen.
George B. McClellan, with his army preparing to move on Richmond,
was denied reinforcements at a critical moment in the Peninsular
Campaign.
<p><p>
In late April, Jackson left part of his enlarged command under
Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to confront Banks and marched with
about 9,000 men through Staunton to meet a second Union army
under Maj. Gen. John C. Fr‚mont, whose vanguard approached on the
Parkersburg Road from western Virginia.  Banks was convinced that
Jackson was leaving the Valley to join the Confederate army at
Richmond.  But on May 8, Jackson turned up to defeat two brigades
of Fr‚mont's force, under Brig. Gens. Robert Milroy and Robert
Schenck, at <a href="svs3-2.html">McDowell</a>.  He then marched
swiftly back to unite with Ewell against Banks.  On May 23,
Jackson overran a detached Union force at <a href="svs3-3.html">
Front Royal</a> and advanced toward Winchester,
threatening to cut off the Union army that was concentrated
around Strasburg.  After a running battle on the 24th along the
Valley Turnpike from Middletown to Newtown (Stephens City), Banks
made a stand on the heights south of <a href="svs3-4.html">
Winchester</a>.  On May 25, Jackson attacked and
overwhelmed the Union defenders, who broke and fled in a panic to
the Potomac River.  Banks was reinforced and again started up the
Valley Turnpike, intending to link up with Brig. Gen. James
Shields's Union division near Strasburg.  Shields's division
spearheaded the march of Irwin McDowell's corps recalled from
Fredericksburg, while Fr‚mont's army converged on Strasburg from
the west.  Jackson withdrew, narrowly avoiding being cut off from
his line of retreat by these converging columns.
<p><p>
The Union armies now began a two-prong offensive against Jackson.

Fr‚mont's troops advanced up the Valley Turnpike while Shields's
column marched up the Luray Road along the South Fork.  At this
point nearly 25,000 men were being brought to bear on Jackson's
17,000.  Jackson's cavalry commander, Brig. Gen. Turner Ashby was
killed while fighting a rear guard action near Harrisonburg on
June 6.
<p><p>
Jackson concentrated his forces near the bridge at Port Republic,
situating himself between the two Union columns that were
separated by the mountain and the rain-swollen Shenandoah South
Fork.  On June 8, Fr‚mont attacked Ewell's division at <a
href="svs3-5.html">Cross Keys</a> but was driven back.  The next
morning (June 9), Jackson with his remaining force attacked
Shields east and north of <a href="svs3-6.html">Port
Republic</a>, while Ewell withdrew from Fr‚mont's front burning
the bridge behind him.  Ewell joined with Jackson to defeat
Shields.  Both Union forces retreated, freeing Jackson's army to
reinforce the Confederate army at Richmond.
<p><p>
In five weeks, Jackson's army had marched more than 650 miles and
inflicted more than 7,000 casualties, at a cost of only 2,500. 
More importantly, Jackson's campaign had tied up Union forces
three times his strength.  Jackson's victories infused new hope
and enthusiasm for the Confederate cause, and materially
contributed to the defeat of McClellan's campaign against
Richmond. (See Map 7, showing incidents of conflict and
battlefield study areas associated with the Jackson's 1862
campaign.)
<p><p>
<B>Lee's Maryland Campaign (September 1862)</B>
After decisively defeating the Union Army of Virginia under Maj.
Gen. John Pope at Second Manassas (August 28-30) and fighting a
drawn battle at Chantilly (September 1), General Lee invaded
Maryland.  Lee's advance was one arm of a great Confederate
offensive that extended along a thousand-mile front from
Tidewater Virginia to the Indian Territory in the west.
<p><p>
Lee's Army of Northern Virginia crossed the Potomac north of
Leesburg and concentrated at Frederick, Maryland, on September 9.

While there, Lee learned that Pope had been removed from command,
and McClellan again had assumed overall control.  He also
discovered that Union garrisons in the Lower Shenandoah Valley at
Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry had not withdrawn as had been
anticipated.  Lee could not continue his invasion with these
troops sitting on his supply line.  He audaciously divided his
army and prepared to move deeper into the North while
simultaneously investing Harpers Ferry.
<p><p>
In the next few days, Jackson's ``Foot Cavalry'' marched via
Williamsport and Martinsburg to approach Harpers Ferry from the
west.  Three other divisions occupied the heights to the north
and east of the town, surrounding the defenders.  Lee left a
division of infantry and the cavalry to hold the South Mountain
passes in the face of any Union advance.  The plan unfolded
flawlessly until a copy of Lee's orders outlining the movements
fell into Union hands.  McClellan then advanced from Frederick,
hoping to defeat the Confederate army in detail.
<p><p>
The US army wrested control of the South Mountain passes, but on
September 15, 12,000 Union soldiers at Harpers Ferry surrendered
to Jackson, even as McClellan moved west to confront Lee at
Sharpsburg.  At dawn on September 17, the Union army launched a
powerful assault on Lee's left flank that began the bloodiest day
in American military history.  Although outnumbered two-to-one,
Lee battled McClellan's army to a standstill.  In one day's
fighting, the two armies suffered a combined total of more than
23,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, captured).  In spite
of crippling casualties, Lee continued to face McClellan
throughout the 18th, while skirmishing.  After dark, Lee ordered
the battered Army of Northern Virginia to withdraw across the
Potomac to the safety of the Shenandoah Valley.  When McClellan
failed to pursue Lee's army, President Lincoln relieved him of
command.
<p><p>
<B>Gettysburg Campaign (June-July 1863)</B>
Union defeats at Fredericksburg in December 1862 and
Chancellorsville in May 1863 gave General Lee the initiative, and
he moved again to invade the North.  After the cavalry battle at
Brandy Station on June 9, Lt. Gen. Richard S.  Ewell's Second
Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, which included Stonewall
Jackson's old command, was assigned the task of clearing Union
forces out of the Valley.  This he accomplished at <a href="svs3-7.html">
Second Winchester</a> (June 13-15), defeating (and nearly
destroying) a Union division under Brig. Gen. Robert Milroy. 
With cavalry holding the Shenandoah Valley gaps, the Confederate
army marched behind the screening Blue Ridge into Maryland and
then penetrated deep into Pennsylvania.
<p><p>
Maj. Gen. George G. Meade replaced Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker as
commander of the Army of the Potomac and brought the invading
Confederate army to battle at the crossroads town of Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania, on July 1.  After two days of fierce fighting in
which Union forces were driven back, General Lee attempted to
break the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.  The
Pickett-Pettigrew Assault, or ``Pickett's Charge'' as it is
known, was bloodily repulsed, and General Lee was forced to
retreat on July 4, the same day that Confederate forces
surrendered to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant
at Vicksburg.  The
battle of Gettysburg, the most sanguinary battle of the war,
resulted in more than 50,000 casualties and a loss of Confederate
manpower that could not be replaced.
<p><p>
The Confederate army reached the rain-swollen Potomac River at
Williamsport on July 6 but could not recross until the 14th, when
it returned to the Shenandoah Valley.  During the retreat,
Confederate forces defended the passes of the Blue Ridge,
allowing Lee's defeated army to withdraw with little molestation.

Meade's Army of the Potomac came close to penetrating Lee's
defensive screen only once--at Manassas Gap east of Front Royal
on July 23.  But the inability of the Federal army to coordinate
their attacks allowed the Confederate army to escape to the
vicinity of Culpeper Courthouse.  (See Map 8, showing incidents
of conflict and battlefield study areas associated with the the
1863 Gettysburg campaign.)
<p><p>
<B>Lynchburg Campaign  (May-June 1864)</B>
In March 1864, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant
assumed overall command
of the Union armies, east and west.  In May, he ordered Maj. Gen.
Franz Sigel to cooperate with the Army of the Potomac's spring
offensive by advancing up the Valley to disrupt Confederate
communications at Staunton and Charlottesville.  On May 15, while
Grant and Lee were locked in desperate combat at Spotsylvania
Courthouse, Sigel made contact with a Confederate force under
former vice president of the United States John C. Breckinridge
at <a href="svs3-8.html">New Market</a>.  Sigel was defeated and
retreated rapidly beyond Strasburg, crossing Cedar Creek by dusk
on May 16.  Grant then replaced Sigel with Maj. Gen. David
``Black Dave'' Hunter, who was given the task of cutting the
Virginia Central Railroad.
<p><p>
In the meantime, Breckinridge's division had been called east to
reinforce the Army of Northern Virginia at Hanover Junction, and
Brig. Gen. William E. ``Grumble'' Jones assumed command of the
remaining Confederate forces in the Valley.  On June 5, Hunter
crushed the smaller Confederate army at <a href="svs3-9.html">
Piedmont</a>, killing Jones and taking nearly 1,000
prisoners.  The disorganized Confederates could do nothing to
delay Hunter's advance to Staunton, where he was joined by
reinforcements marching from West Virginia.
<p><p>
From Staunton, Hunter continued south, sporadically destroying
mills, barns, and public buildings, and condoning widespread
looting by his troops.  On June 11, Hunter swept aside a small
cavalry force and occupied Lexington, where he burned the
Virginia Military Institute and the home of former Virginia
Governor John Letcher.  Hunter's successes forced Lee to return
Breckinridge and to send the Second Corps of the Army of Northern
Virginia under Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early to the defense of
Lynchburg.  Sending Early to the Valley was a desperate decision
that restricted Lee's ability to undertake offensive operations
against Grant on the Richmond-Petersburg front.
<p><p>
On the afternoon of June 17, Hunter's army reached the outskirts
of Lynchburg, even as Early's vanguard began to arrive by rail
from Charlottesville.  After a brief, but fierce engagement,
Hunter retreated into West Virginia.  Early pursued for two days,
but then returned to the Valley and started his troops north to
the Potomac River.  (See Map 9, showing incidents of conflict and
battlefield study areas associated with the 1864 Lynchburg
campaigns.)
<p><p>
<B>Early's Maryland Campaign (June-August 1864)</B>
Hunter's retreat left the Shenandoah Valley virtually undefended,
and Early moved swiftly north, reaching Winchester by July 2. 
General Sigel, commanding a reserve division, withdrew to
Maryland Heights at Harpers Ferry, offering little resistance. 
On July 4, Early confronted Sigel but then determined to turn the
position by crossing the Potomac and moving over South Mountain
to Frederick, Maryland.  On July 9, Early defeated a hastily
organized Union force under Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace at the Monocacy
River.  Wallace retreated toward Baltimore, leaving open the road
to Washington, but his defeat had bought valuable time.
<p><p>
On the afternoon of July 11, Early's command, numbering no more
than 12,000 infantry, demonstrated before the Washington
fortifications, which were weakly manned by garrison troops. 
Veteran reinforcements (VI and XIX Corps), diverted from Grant's
army to meet the threat on the capital, began arriving at mid-
day, and by July 12, fully manned the Washington entrenchments. 
After a brief demonstration at Fort Stevens, Early called off an
attack on the capital.  The Confederate army withdrew that night,
recrossed the Potomac River at White's Ford and reentered the
Valley by Snickers Gap.  Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright, commanding the
pursuing Union army, attempted to bring Early to bay.
<p><p>
On July 18, a Union division crossed the Shenandoah River west of
Snickers Gap but was thrown back at the battle of <a href="svs3-10.html">
Cool Spring</a>.  Union cavalry were turned back at Berry's
Ferry, nine miles farther south, the next day.  On July 20, Union
Brig. Gen. William Averell's mounted command, backed by infantry,
moved south from Martinsburg on the Valley Turnpike and attacked
the infantry division of Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Ramseur at
Rutherford's Farm near Winchester and routed it.  In response to
this setback and converging threats, Early withdrew to Fisher's
Hill south of Strasburg.
<p><p>
Early's withdrawal convinced Wright that he had accomplished his
task of driving off the Confederate invaders.  He therefore
ordered the VI and XIX Corps to return to Alexandria, where they
would board transports to join the Army of the Potomac.  Wright
left Crook with three small infantry divisions and a cavalry
division at Winchester to cover the Valley.
<p><p>
Under a standing directive to prevent Union reinforcements from
reaching Grant, Early was quick to take advantage of Wright's
departure.  He attacked and routed Crook's command at <a
href="svs3-11.html">Second Kernstown</a> on July 24, and pressed
the retreating Union forces closely.  When Crook retreated toward
Harpers Ferry, Early sent his cavalry to Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania, to exact tribute or burn the city.  The citizens
refused to comply, and McCausland's cavalry burned the center of
the town in retaliation for Hunter's excesses in the Valley. 
(See Map 10, showing incidents of conflict and battlefield study
areas associated with Early's 1864 campaign in the Valley only.)
<p><p>
<B>Sheridan's Valley Campaign (August 1864-March 1865)</B>
Early's threat to Washington, Crook's defeat at Second Kernstown,
and the burning of Chambersburg, forced Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant
move decisively to end the Confederate threat in the lower
Shenandoah Valley.  Grant returned the VI and XIX Corps to the
Valley, reinforced by two divisions of cavalry, and consolidated
the various military districts of the region under Maj. Gen.
Philip H. Sheridan, who assumed command of the Middle Military
District at Harpers Ferry on August 7.
<p><p>
Early deployed his forces to defend the approaches to Winchester,
while Sheridan moved his army, now 50,000 strong, south via
Berryville with the goal of cutting the Valley Turnpike.  On
August 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry turned back Union
cavalry at Double Toll Gate in sporadic, day-long fighting,
preventing this maneuver.
<p><p>
Lee was quick to reinforce success and sent Maj. Gen. Joseph
Kershaw's infantry division of the First Corps, Fitzhugh Lee's
cavalry division, and an artillery battalion, under overall
command of Lt. Gen. Richard Anderson, to join Early.  On August
16, Union cavalry encountered this force advancing through Front
Royal, and in a sharp engagement at Guard Hill, Brig. Gen. George
A. Custer's brigade captured more than 300 Confederates.
<p><p>
Sheridan had been ordered to move cautiously and avoid a defeat,
particularly if Early were reinforced from the Petersburg line. 
Uncertain of Early's and Anderson's combined strength, Sheridan
withdrew to a defensive line near Charles Town to cover the
Potomac River crossings and Harpers Ferry.  Early's forces routed
the Union rear guard at Abrams Creek at Winchester on August 17
and pressed north on the Valley Turnpike to Bunker Hill.  Judging
Sheridan's performance thus far, General Early considered him a
``timid'' commander.
<p><p>
On August 21, Early and Anderson launched a converging attack
against Sheridan.  As Early struck the main body of Union
infantry at Cameron's Depot, Anderson moved north from Berryville
against Sheridan's cavalry at Summit Point.  Results of the
fighting were inconclusive, but Sheridan continued to withdraw. 
The next day, Early advanced boldly on Charles Town, panicking a
portion of the retreating Union army, but by late afternoon,
Sheridan had retreated into formidable entrenchments at Halltown,
south of Harpers Ferry, where he was beyond attack.
<p><p>
Early then attempted another incursion into Maryland, hoping by
this maneuver to maintain the initiative.  Leaving Anderson with
Kershaw's division entrenched in front of Sheridan at Halltown,
he directed the rest of the army north toward Shepherdstown.  On
August 25, two divisions of Sheridan's cavalry intercepted
Early's advance, but the Confederate infantry drove them back to
the Potomac River in a series of actions along Kearneysville-
Shepherdstown Road.  Early's intentions were revealed, however,
and on August 26, Sheridan's infantry attacked and overran a
portion of the Confederate entrenchments at Halltown, forcing
Anderson and Kershaw to withdraw to Stephenson's Depot.  Early
abandoned his raid and returned south, establishing a defensive
line on the west bank of Opequon Creek from Bunker Hill to
Stephenson's Depot.
<p><p>
On August 29, Union cavalry forded the Opequon at Smithfield
Crossing (Middleway) but were swiftly driven back across the
creek and beyond the hamlet by Confederate infantry.  Union
infantry of the VI Corps then advanced and regained the line of
the Opequon.  This was one more in a series of thrusts and
parries that characterized this phase of the campaign, known to
the soldiers as the ``mimic war.''
<p><p>
On September 2-3, Averell's cavalry division rode south from
Martinsburg and struck the Confederate left flank at Bunker Hill,
defeating the Confederate cavalry but being driven back by
infantry.  Meanwhile, Sheridan concentrated his infantry near
Berryville.  On the afternoon of September 3, Anderson's command
encountered and attacked elements of Crook's corps (Army of West
Virginia) at Berryville but was repulsed.  Early brought his
entire army up on the 4th, but found Sheridan's position at
Berryville too strongly entrenched to attack.  Early again
withdrew to the Opequon line.
<p><p>
On September 15, Anderson with Kershaw's division and an
artillery battalion left the Winchester area to return to Lee's
army at Petersburg and by the 18th had reached the Virginia
Piedmont.  Early spread out his remaining divisions from
Winchester to Martinsburg, where he once more cut the B&O
Railroad.  When Sheridan learned of Anderson's departure and the
raid on Martinsburg, he determined to attack at once while the
Confederate army was scattered.
<p><p>
On September 19, Sheridan advanced his army on the Berryville
Turnpike, precipitating the battle of <a href="svs3-12.html">
Opequon</a>.  By forced marches, Early concentrated his
army in time to intercept Sheridan's main blow.  The battle raged
all day on the hills east and north of Winchester.  Early's
veterans decimated two divisions of the XIX Corps and a VI Corps
division in fighting in the Middle Field and near the Dinkle
Barn.  Confederate division commander Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes
and Union division commander Brig. Gen. David A. Russell were
killed within a few hundred yards of one another in the heat of
the fighting.  Late in the afternoon a flanking movement by
Crook's corps and the Union cavalry finally broke Early's
overextended line north of town.  Opequon was a do-or-die effort
on the part of both armies, resulting in nearly 9,000 casualties.
<p><p>
Sheridan's victory was decisive but incomplete; Early retreated
twenty miles south to his entrenchments at <a href="svs3-13.html">
Fisher's Hill</a> and Sheridan followed.  Preliminary
skirmishing on the 21st showed that a frontal assault would be
costly, so Sheridan resorted to a flanking movement on September
22.  Hidden from the Confederate signal station on Massanutten
Mountain by the dense forest, Crook's two divisions marched along
the shoulder of Little North Mountain to get behind the
Confederate lines.  In late afternoon, Crook's soldiers fell on
Early's left flank and rear ``like an avalanche,'' throwing the
Confederate army into panicked retreat.  At Milford (Overall) in
the Luray Valley on the same day Confederate cavalry prevented
two divisions of Union cavalry from reaching Luray and passing
New Market Gap to intercept Early's defeated army as it withdrew
up the Valley.
<p><p>
Early retreated to Rockfish Gap near Waynesboro, opening the
Valley to Union depredations and what became known as ``The
Burning'' or ``Red October.'' Sheridan thought he had destroyed
Early's army, but Kershaw's division and another brigade of
cavalry were returned to the Valley, nearly making up the losses
suffered at Opequon and Fisher's Hill.  After convincing Grant
that he could proceed no farther than Staunton, Sheridan withdrew
down the Valley systematically burning mills, barns, and public
buildings, destroying or carrying away the forage, grain, and
livestock.  During this portion of the campaign, Confederate
partisan groups under John S. Mosby and <a
href="svsgilmr.html">Harry Gilmor</a> increased their activities
against Union supply lines in the Lower Valley.
<p><p>
Early followed Sheridan's withdrawal, sending his cavalry under
Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Rosser to harass the Union rear guard. 
Angered by Rosser's constant skirmishing, Sheridan ordered his
commander of cavalry, Maj. Gen. Alfred T. Torbert, to ``whip the
enemy or get whipped yourself.'' On October 9, Torbert unleashed
the divisions of his young generals, Wesley Merritt and George
Custer, on the Confederate cavalry, routing it at <a href="svs3-14.html">
Tom's Brook</a>.  In the melee that followed, victorious
Union troopers chased the Confederates twenty miles up the pike
and eight miles up the Back Road, in what came to be known as the
``Woodstock Races.'' The morale and efficiency of the Confederate
cavalry were seriously impaired for the rest of the war.
<p><p>
On October 13, Early reoccupied Fisher's Hill and pushed through
Strasburg to Hupp's Hill where he engaged a portion of Sheridan's
army.  When Sheridan realized the proximity of Early's forces, he
recalled the VI Corps, which had again been dispatched to join
Grant.  On October 19, at dawn, after an unparalleled night
march, Confederate infantry directed by Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon
surprised and overwhelmed the soldiers of Crook's corps in their
camps at <a href="svs3-15.html">Cedar Creek</a>.  The XIX Corps
suffered a like fate as the rest of Early's army joined the
attack.  Only the VI Corps maintained its order as it withdrew
beyond Middletown, providing a screen behind which the other
corps could regroup.
<p><p>
Sheridan, who was absent when the attack began, arrived on the
field from Winchester and immediately began to organize a
counterattack, saying ``if I had been with you this morning,
boys, this would not have happened.'' In late afternoon, the
Union army launched a coordinated counterattack that drove the
Confederates back across Cedar Creek.  Sheridan's leadership
turned the tide, transforming Early's stunning morning victory
into afternoon disaster.  Early retreated up the Valley under
sharp criticism of his generalship, while President Abraham
Lincoln rode the momentum of Sheridan's victories in the Valley
and Sherman's successes in the Atlanta campaign to re-election in
November.  A campaign slogan of the time duly noted that the
``Early'' bird had gotten its ``Phil.''
<p><p>
Early attempted a last offensive in mid-November, advancing to
Middletown.  But his weakened cavalry was defeated by Union
cavalry at Newtown (Stephens City) and Ninevah, forcing him to
withdraw his infantry.  The Union cavalry now so overpowered his
own that Early could not maneuver offensively against Sheridan. 
On November 22, the cavalry fought at Rude's Hill, and on
December 12, a second Union cavalry raid was turned back at Lacey
Springs, ending active operations for the winter season.  The
winter was disastrous for the Confederate army, which was no
longer able to sustain itself on the produce of the devastated
Valley.  Cavalry and infantry were returned to Lee's army at
Petersburg or dispersed to feed and forage for themselves.
<p><p>
Riding through sleet on March 2, 1865, Custer's and Brig. Gen.
Thomas Devin's cavalry divisions advanced from Staunton, arriving
near Waynesboro in the early afternoon.  There, they found
Early's small army, consisting of a remnant of Brig. Gen. Gabriel
Wharton's division and some artillery units.  Early presented a
brave front although the South River was to his rear, but in a
few hours, the war for the Shenandoah Valley was over.  Early's
army fled before the Union cavalry, scattering up the
mountainside.  Early escaped with a few of his aides, riding away
from his last battle with no forces left to contest Union control
of the Shenandoah Valley.

With the Confederate threat in the Valley eliminated, General
Sheridan led his cavalry overland to Petersburg to participate in
the final campaign of the war in Virginia.  On April 9, 1865,
after collapse of the Petersburg lines and a harried retreat,
General <A HREF="relee.gif">Robert E. Lee </A>surrendered the
Army of Northern Virginia to General <A HREF="relee.gif">Ulysses
S. Grant</A> at Appomattox Courthouse. (See Map 11, showing
incidents of conflict and battlefield study areas associated with
Sheridan's campaign, 1864-1865.)
