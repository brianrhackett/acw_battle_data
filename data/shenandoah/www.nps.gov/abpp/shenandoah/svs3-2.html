<b>Significance:</b> Some historians consider the battle of
McDowell the beginning of ``Stonewall'' Jackson's 1862 Valley
Campaign, while others prefer to include First Kernstown,
Stonewall's only defeat.  The battle of McDowell is studied today
by military historians for several reasons.  At the tactical
level, it can be argued that the US forces achieved a draw. 
Milroy's ``spoiling attack'' surprised Jackson, seized the
initiative, and inflicted heavier casualties, but did not drive
the Confederates from their position.  Historians derive lessons
about use of terrain, small unit tactics and leadership, and
overexuberance under fire (12th Georgia).  At the strategic
level, the battle of McDowell and the resultant withdrawal of the
US army was an important victory for the South.  The battle
demonstrated Jackson's strategy of concentrating his forces
against a numerically inferior foe, while denying his enemies the
chance to concentrate against him.  Jackson rode the momentum of
his strategic win at McDowell to victory at Front Royal (23 May)
and First Winchester (25 May).

<h2>Description of the Battle</h2>
<p><p>
<b>Phase One.  CS Advance on Parkersburg Turnpike (7 May):</b>
Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's columns departed West View and
Staunton on the morning of 7 May, marching west along the
Parkersburg turnpike.  Elements of Brig. Gen. Edward Johnson's
brigade composed the vanguard.  At mid-afternoon, Union pickets
were encountered at Rodgers' tollgate, where the pike crosses
Ramsey's Draft.  The Union force, which consisted of portions of
three regiments (3WV, 32OH, 75OH) under overall command of Brig.
Gen. Robert Milroy, withdrew hastily, abandoning their baggage at
the tollgate and retreating to the crest of Shenandoah Mountain.
<p><p>
At Rodgers', Johnson and Jackson conferred.  The Confederate
force split into two columns to envelope the US holding position
on Shenandoah Mountain.  Milroy ordered his force to withdraw and
concentrate at McDowell, where he hoped to receive
reinforcements.  Milroy also positioned a section of artillery on
Shaw's Ridge to impede Johnson's descent from the crest of
Shenandoah Mountain.  These guns were soon withdrawn with their
supports to McDowell.  By dusk, Johnson's advance regiments
reached Shaw's Fork where they encamped.  Because of the narrow
roads and few camp sites, Jackson's army was stretched 8-10 miles
back along the pike with its rear guard at Dry Branch Gap. 
Jackson established his headquarters at Rodgers' tollgate. 
During the night, Milroy withdrew behind the Bullpasture River to
McDowell, establishing headquarters in the Hull House.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Two.  CS Advance to Sitlington's Hill (8 May):</b>
Starting at dawn of 8 May, the Confederate advance crossed Shaw's
Ridge, descended to the Cowpasture River at Wilson's House, and
ascended Bullpasture Mountain.  The advance was unopposed. 
Reaching the crest of the ridge, Jackson and Jedediah Hotchkiss
conducted a reconnaissance of the Union position at McDowell from
a rocky spur right of the road.  Johnson continued with the
advance to the base of Sitlington's Hill.  Expecting a roadblock
ahead, he diverged from the road into a steep narrow ravine that
leads to the top of the hill.  After driving away Union
skirmishers, Johnson deployed his infantry along the long,
sinuous crest of the hill.  Jackson asked his staff to find a way
to place artillery on the hill and to search for a way to flank
the Union position to the north.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Three.  Deployment of US Forces:</b> About 1000 hours,
Brig. Gen. Robert Schenck arrived after a forced march from
Franklin.  Being senior to Milroy, Schenck assumed overall
command of the Union force at McDowell with headquarters at the
Hull House.  He deployed his artillery, consisting of 18 guns on
Cemetery Hill and near the McDowell Presbyterian Church to defend
the bridge over the Bullpasture River.  He deployed his infantry
in line from McDowell south along the river for about 800 yards. 
He placed one regiment (2WV) on Hull's Hill, west of the river
and overlooking the pike.  Three companies of cavalry covered the
left flank on the road to the north of the village.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Four.  US Attack on Sitlington's Hill:</b> Schenck and
Milroy sent out skirmishers to contest the base of Sitlington's
Hill along the river.  As CS forces on the crest of the hill
increased in numbers, Schenck and Milroy conferred.  Union scouts
reported that the Confederates were attempting to bring artillery
to the crest of the hill which would make the US position on the
bottomland at McDowell untenable.  In absence of an aggressive CS
advance, Schenck and Milroy attempted a spoiling attack.  Milroy
advanced his brigade (25OH, 32OH, 75OH, 3WV) and the 82nd Ohio of
Schenck's brigade, about 2,300 men.  About 1500 hours Milroy
personally led the attacking force, which crossed the bridge and
proceeded up the ravines that cut the western slope of the hill.
<p><p>
In the meantime, Jackson had been content to hold the crest of
the hill while searching for a route for a flanking movement to
the north.  He declined to send artillery up the hill because of
the difficulty of withdrawing the pieces in the face of an
attack.  Union artillerymen on Cemetery Hill elevated their
pieces by digging deep trenches in the ground for the gun trails
and began firing at the Confederates in support of the advancing
infantry.  Schenck also had a six-pounder hauled by hand to the
crest of Hull's Hill to fire on the CS right flank above the
turnpike (some accounts say a section of guns, another says a
whole battery).  The Union line advanced resolutely up the steep
slopes and closed on the Confederate position.  The conflict
became ``fierce and sanguinary.''
<p><p>
The 3rd West Virginia advanced along the turnpike in an attempt
to turn the CS right.  Jackson reinforced his right on the hill
with two regiments and covered the turnpike with the 21st
Virginia.  The 12th Georgia at the center and slightly in advance
of the main CS line on the hill crest bore the brunt of the Union
attack and suffered heavy casualties.  The fighting continued for
four hours as the Union attackers attempted to pierce the center
of the CS line and then to envelope its left flank.  Nine CS
regiments were engaged, opposing five US regiments in the fight
for Sitlington's Hill.  At dusk the Union attackers withdrew to
McDowell.
<p><p>
<b>Phase Five.  Union Withdrawal (9 May):</b> At dark US forces
withdrew from Sitlington's Hill and recrossed to McDowell,
carrying their wounded from the field.  About 0200 hours of 9
May, Schenck and Milroy ordered a general retreat along the
turnpike toward Franklin.  The 73rd Ohio held their skirmish line
along the river until near dawn when they withdrew and acted as
rear guard for the retreating column.  Ten men of the regiment
were inadvertently left behind and captured.  Shortly after the
Federals retired, the Confederates entered McDowell.  Schenck
established a holding position on 9 May (north of modern
intersection of rte. 629 and US 220) but only minor skirmishing
resulted.  For nearly a week, Jackson pursued the retreating
Union army almost to Franklin before commencing a return march to
the Valley on 15 May.

<h2>Current Condition of the Battlefield</h2>
<p><p>
The battlefield of McDowell retains the highest integrity of all
of the Shenandoah Valley battlefields surveyed; this is due to
its location and the rugged nature of the ground, which precludes
almost any land use other than agriculture or woodland.  Highland
County retains a low population density (fewer residents now than
at the time of the battle) and a distinct rural character.  In
general, the landscape consists of narrow river valleys which are
farmed and high ridge lines which are mostly forested with
interspersed pastureland.  The line of Jackson's advance along
rte. 250 passes through the George Washington National Forest,
which ends at the Cowpasture River.  The core of the battlefield
on Sitlington's Hill is owned and preserved by the Association
for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS) and the Lee-
Jackson Foundation.  Together the two groups own more than 200
acres bounded by rte. 250 on the east and north, including the
ravine used by CS troops to reach the summit and main areas of
attack and defense.  A single individual owns the remaining
portions of Sitlington's Hill.  A hiking trail on APCWS property
leads to the crest of Sitlington's Hill, providing unmarked
access for visitors.
<p><p>
The village of McDowell retains much character, including many
historic structures: a renovated mill next to the bridge,
Presbyterian Church (used as a field hospital by both sides), and
the Hull House (Federal headquarters).  The general store and
other structures appear to date from about 1900.  Hull's Hill
north of rte. 250 is privately owned; its crest is maintained as
pastureland as at the time of the battle, while its slopes and
base are heavily wooded.
<p><p>
<h2>Perception of Threats to Battlefield</h2>
The general perception is that the battlefield of McDowell was
substantially preserved by the recent APCWS acquisition of about
100 acres on Sitlington's Hill.  The county's economy is
sluggish, compared with that of the Shenandoah Valley proper, and
little development of any kind is present.  The county prides
itself on its annual Highland Maple Festival, which attracts
thousands of visitors every spring.  Local residents are content
that ``their battlefield'' is in one piece, and many expressed
the desire that more tourists could be attracted to McDowell to
visit it.  The Hull House is currently occupied seasonally and
the structure appears in good condition.
