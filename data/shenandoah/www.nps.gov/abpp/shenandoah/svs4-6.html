<H2>6. Preservation and Interpretation Potential</H2>
<p><p>
This section describes the preservation and interpretation
scenarios for each of the battlefields, drawing upon the
descriptions of condition and threat outlined in Part Three of
this report, current land use practices, and upon comments
received from individuals and local governments during the public
comment period.  These possibilities for preservation and
interpretation are offered as guidance to the types of actions
that could be pursued at each site within a regional preservation
framework. Sites are discussed in order, from the most at risk to
the least at risk.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-3.html">1. Front Royal:</a> Preservation and
interpretation efforts for this battlefield would need to focus,
first, on providing an adequate driving tour of the remaining
resources.  Many visitors could be encouraged to drive Stonewall
Jackson's route from Limeton to Cedarville, if the route was
marked and interpreted.  Such a tour would pass through the
center of town, tempting visitors to visit the city's museums and
patronize its businesses.  Interpretive signage at Prospect Hill
Cemetery would enable an understanding of the battle areas
covered over by the town of Front Royal.  Access to the North and
South Fork bridge sites would assist interpretation and might be
acquired by public access easement.  Public access by hiking
trail to an overlook on the crest of Guard Hill could be sought
by donation or by easement.  The Thomas McKay House and US
surrender site north of Cedarville would probably need to be
acquired by purchase and considerable restoration work would be
required to make the site attractive to visitors.  (Even in its
current condition, several hundred visitors stop there each
year.)  <i>Summary:</i> Potential for driving tour with several
interpretive stops in an altered setting.  The level of local
government support for such an effort is unknown.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-4.html">2. First Winchester:</a> Although lost as a
coherent landscape, enough remains of the battlefield to allow
commemoration and some level of interpretation of the events. 
Bowers Hill, which was the focus of the Federal defense, remains
a prominent landmark, despite residential development.  The
importance of this site could be appreciated by an overlook and
interpretive shelter on the crest of the hill that lies west of
and adjacent to US 11, north of rte. 622, and south of the
abandoned Winchester and Western railroad spur.  The abandoned
spur line could be modified as a trail with interpretive signs
along the way.  This path parallels the course taken by the
Louisiana brigade on its way to assault Bowers Hill.  Easements
could be sought to allow hikers to climb from the railroad to the
hill crest and overlook.  The site would retain interpretive
value even if the planned residential construction for this area
occurs.  The developers of the site might benefit by a combined
recreational and interpretive trail that serves residents, while
at the same time allowing public appreciation of the battlefield
site.  <i>Summary:</i> Landscape preservation options are
extremely limited.  Potential exists for public-private
interpretive/commemorative effort utilizing small parcels within
a vastly altered setting.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-12.html">3. Opequon:</a> One of the largest and
most significant battlefields of the Valley, a portion of its
core--east of I-81, south of Redbud Road, west of rte. 656, and
north of the residential and commercial development along VA
7--retains considerable integrity.  The potential remains here
for some form of larger scale landscape preservation, although
currently much of the area is scheduled for residential
development.  Hackwood Estate, which was recently on the market,
was a focal point of the battle and could be acquired by
purchase.  With Hackwood Estate alone, the battle could be
interpreted, although this would fall short of landscape
preservation.  Adjacent lands in the First Woods and Middle Field
sections (where from a third to half of the battle's fatalities
were incurred) would probably need to be acquired fee-simple. 
The properties' owners have expressed a previous willingness to
sell.  Redbud Run Valley, if protected by easements, could
provide a scenic-natural corridor and wildlife refuge, of
particular value if residential development in the area continues
to fill in the available open space.  The City of Winchester and
Frederick County have expressed an interest in efforts to
establish a visitor contact facility at this site.  Such an
effort would be expensive and may not be timely enough to prevent
loss of remaining resources. <i>Summary:</i> Potential for
preserving 200 to 900 acres of the core area exists through fee
simple acquisition.  Park establishment might be supported by
local governments.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-11.html">4. Second Kernstown:</a> The key to
interpreting Second Kernstown battlefield is Pritchard's Hill. 
Without this feature in its current setting, the battlefield
would be lost.  The view from Opequon Church (where there are
currently interpretive signs) to Pritchard's Hill enables a full
interpretation of the battle, making it essential that the
intervening property be protected through zoning, easements,
incentives, or some other arrangement suitable to the owners. 
<i>Summary:</i>  This property displays potential for a
battlefield park of manageable proportions.  Local government
officials have expressed interest in exploring the potential of a
park at this site.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-7.html">5. Second Winchester:</a> The essential
fieldwork, Star Fort, is critically endangered.  Although about 7
acres of the fort area is currently preserved, the surrounding 50
acres is zoned commercial/industrial and would probably need to
be acquired fee simple on the open market to preserve the
viewshed.  Some public access to Fort Milroy could probably be
negotiated but restoration would be required.  The viewshed from
Apple Pie Ridge to West Fort (Louisiana Heights) could be
protected by the purchase of easements.  This would be an ideal
site for an interpretive shelter and battle map.  The land south
of Stephenson's Depot (bounded by US 11, rte. 761, rte. 662, and
rte. 838) is by far the best preserved part of the battlefield
and holds great potential for interpretation.  This parcel would
probably need to acquired fee simple.  <i>Summary:</i>  Landscape
preservation potential exists but at a limited number of sites. 
Significant parcels would need to be acquired soon--fee simple
purchase--in order to prevent further deterioration of this
battlefield.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-8.html">6. New Market:</a>  The VMI New Market
Battlefield Park could be enlarged by acquiring more land from
willing sellers.  This would expand the ability to protect and
interpret the battlefield.  A study should be conducted to
determine if I-81 could be screened in some way to make it less
intrusive without further disrupting the landscape contours.  The
existing battlefield park could serve as an access point for
visitors who wish to see other Valley battlefields. 
<i>Summary:</i>  Acquisition of property or easements from
willing sellers would enhance the preserved portions of the
battlefield.  The battlefield park would require some form of
assistance.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-1.html">7. First Kernstown:</a> Pritchard's Hill
(See Second Kernstown) and Sand Ridge form the interpretive
nuclei of the First Kernstown battlefield.  Although bisected by
the VA 37 bypass, these parcels are visually and strategically
related.  The Sand Ridge parcel cannot be adequately interpreted
from the road.  Access through easement or donation would be
required.  The Sand Ridge parcel has been placed in the Glen
Burnie Trust.  Some means should be found to provide further
incentive to the owner to maintain the land in its current
condition.  <i>Summary:</i>  If coupled with the parcel discussed
under Second Kernstown, this property displays great potential
for a park of manageable proportions.  Park establishment might
be supported by the local governments.  Such a park could serve
as an introduction to two major Valley campaigns.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-14.html">8. Tom's Brook:</a>  This battlefield
could be interpreted from the vantage point of Sand Ridge Church.
Easements could be on Tom's Brook Valley and on the opposing
portions of Spiker's Hill.  An overlook could be established on
the site where Custer rode out and doffed his hat to his
opponent.  A marked hiking trail, leading from North Mountain to
the Massanutten Mountain already traverses the battlefield along
the county roads.  The viewshed from Spiker's Hill to the head of
Massanutten Mountain is one of the most striking of the Valley
and could be protected through easements and planning at the
county level.  Interpretive signs could be placed in the existing
county park to describe fighting on the Valley Pike.  Under
current plans, it appears that Round Hill, a distinctive
landmark, eventually may be encircled by commercial and
industrial development, spawned by the interstate interchange. 
Efforts to preserve the rural character of sections of the cross
roads between Back Road and the Valley Pike (rtes. 653, 655, 657,
and 642), which were used as routes of maneuver by the US
cavalry, would enhance the battlefield setting.  <i>Summary:</i> 
Landscape preservation is possible and desirable but would
require easement protection for hundreds of acres.  Fee simple
acquisition might be required to preserve portions of the core
areas.  Acquisition of public access easements and an
interpretive overlook at Spiker's Hill would be crucial.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-10.html">9. Cool Spring:</a> Much of the
battlefield on the west bank of the river is owned by the Holy
Cross Abbey, which has expressed a desire to maintain its high
integrity.  A golf course is scheduled for redevelopment on the
east bank, and the historic Judge Parker House would serve as a
club house.  The owners might be willing to offer some public
access to the fords and interpretive signage. Technical
assistance could be offered in this endeavor.  <i>Summary:</i> 
Potential exists for cooperation among private owners to reach a
development/preservation compromise that would benefit all
parties.  Public access will probably continue to be limited to
appointment.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-13.html">10. Fisher's Hill:</a> This site offers
much potential for developing a creative solution to the private
property-public access issue.  Much of the battle can be
interpreted from the roads with well-designed pull-offs and
signage.  With cooperation of landowners, a hiking trail could be
designed to follow a portion of the surviving CS entrenchments,
using the old bridge site and roadbed of the Valley Pike as an
access point.  This would require a footbridge over the creek,
which could be gated to prevent unauthorized access.  Easements
given for the hiking trail could be modeled on the Trails for
Vermont contract, which allows persons to use a trail only if
they register, stay within bounds, and follow specified rules. 
Property owners could revoke right-of-way, if there are
violations.  The potential for private development of battlefield
resources is significant: the old mill would be admirably suited
as a museum and interpretive center; several period homes in the
area could be developed as bed and breakfast inns.  Private
development of this type would need to be directed by the local
landowners and supported by incentives.  APCWS owns 195 acres of
the battlefield, providing a suitable core for visitation.  The
conservation fund holds a protective easement on about 80 acres. 
<i>Summary:</i>  Scenic valley.  High potential for public-
private battlefield development, utilizing creative public access
techniques built around currently protected portion of
battlefield core.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-15.html">11. Cedar Creek:</a> The National Trust
and the Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation have made a good start
in preserving portions of the battlefield around Belle Grove
Mansion through private donations.  Their efforts should be
supported.  Several adjacent parcels could be acquired
immediately from willing sellers.  The viability of agriculture
is slipping at this end of Frederick County, and some means could
be found to support farmers to retain as much land as possible in
agricultural production.  The landscape between Belle Grove and
Cemetery Hill is most in danger of residential development, and
hundreds of acres would need to be protected through purchase of
easements in order to retain the high integrity of the currently
preserved parcels.  <i>Summary:</i>  The landscape is largely
intact with some intrusions.  Retaining the integrity of
currently preserved portions of the battlefield core will require
fee simple acquisition of several large parcels and negotiated
easements on hundreds of acres more.  Because of the significance
of this battle, this National Historic Landmark property displays
potential for a Federal battlefield park.  Park establishment
would be supported at some level by the local governments. 
Because of the potential expense, vital portions of the
battlefield north of Middletown might need to be given a lower
priority for action.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-9.html">12. Piedmont:</a> This battlefield can be
interpreted from the public roads with adequate signage, pull-
offs, and interpretive materials.  Farmers could be encouraged to
continue the agricultural use of their property by some form of
incentives.  Local landowners organized to form a county
agricultural preservation district that encompasses much of the
battlefield.  These landowners could be supported by tax or other
incentives.  A small, interpretive wayside with a battle map
could be established near the angle of the Confederate line where
``Grumble'' Jones was killed.  <i>Summary:</i>  Landscape is
largely intact.  Minimal public access is needed.  Easements
would be required at specified interpretive stops and where
necessary to protect battlefield land where agricultural
incentives are not successful.  Agricultural preservation
incentives are recommended.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-5.html">13. Cross Keys:</a> Cross Keys offers a
wonderful opportunity for landscape preservation, using the
agricultural preservation district approach.  The Lee-Jackson
Foundation owns 100 acres of key ground on Victory Hill, allowing
public access.  This ground would need to be cleared of scrub and
an unobtrusive, interpretive shelter put into place.  Easements
could be acquired, allowing public access to battle sites not
visible from the roads.  Restoration of the old Cross Keys Tavern
by private groups should be supported and encouraged. 
<i>Summary:</i>  The landscape is largely intact.  Currently
preserved land could be secured by purchase of easements on
adjacent parcels.  Easements for public access would be required
at several sites within the battlefield.  There is potential for
developing a battlefield hiking trail.  Agricultural preservation
incentives are recommended.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-6.html">14. Port Republic:</a> Port Republic
battlefield can be viewed almost entirely from public roads with
adequate signage and interpretive materials.  APCWS owns about 8
acres at the Coaling site, allowing interpretation from this
vantage point.  The bottomland, where severe fighting occurred,
is currently farmed.  The railroad right-of-way across this
ground could be used to provide public access if deemed
necessary.  Easements could be sought or incentives provided to
continue agricultural use on this portion of the battlefield. 
The village of Port Republic is listed on the National Register,
and the Society of Port Republic Preservationists has recently
purchased the ``Turner Ashby House'' to serve as a museum and
potential interpretive center for the town and battle.  With
adequate support, the site could serve as a public access point
for the battles of Cross Keys, Port Republic, and Piedmont. 
<i>Summary:</i>  Potential exists for public-private cooperation
in preserving and interpreting three nearby battlefields. 
Landscape is largely intact.  Agricultural preservation
incentives are recommended.
<p><p>
<a href="svs3-2.html">15. McDowell:</a> Pristine and scenic, the
battlefield holds great potential for attracting visitors, who
are interested in nature as well as history.  The APCWS and the
Lee-Jackson Foundation own about 200 acres of battlefield core,
including the crest of Sitlington's Hill and a hiking trail to
reach it.  The view of the Valley is well worth the arduous
climb.  Currently, there is no on-site interpretation, and this
would need to be expanded.  An interpretive shelter in the town
with several cannon (perhaps at the site of US batteries on
Cemetery Hill) would encourage visitors.  <i>Summary:</i> 
Landscape is largely preserved and protected.  Interpretive
assistance is required.
