<H2>5. Battlefield Resources</H2>
<p>
A Civil War battle followed its own rules of logic based on:
standard movements, deployments, and tactics; the range and
capabilities of weaponry; and the advantages and obstacles of the
terrain.  How these elements came together on a field of battle,
on the other hand, was unique.  The battlefield is the landscape
over which the armies contended.  The outcome often relied upon
the personalities of the commanders, the disposition and attitude
of the troops, the celerity of movement, the supply of
ammunition, food, or water, even, the weather. The road network,
natural features such as watercourses, ridges and ravines, river
fords and bridges, the location of a town, a church, mill, or
farm house and its outbuildings, the pattern of open fields and
woodlots separated by stone or rail fences--all these features,
in large measure, defined the course of a battle.  
<p>
<p>
All of these topographical and structural features, or survivals
such as foundations or abandoned roadbeds, make up a major class
of battlefield resources.  If topographical features survive, a
battlefield can be studied to answer important research questions
about strategy and tactics.  The location of an assault can be
pinpointed, and, more importantly, a conclusion reached about why
the assault succeeded or failed.  The assaulting troops may have
bogged down in a swamp at the base of the hill, for example.  Or
high ground to the west may have offered the ideal position for
defending artillery.  Little of this direct knowledge can be
attained from books or battle reports.
<p>
<p>
Buildings and structures that were present at the time of the
battle are an important battlefield resource.  Often these
buildings served as headquarters, bivouacs, sharpshooter havens,
or field hospitals.  Researchers can use deed information or
verbal history to identify the inhabitants of houses at the time
of the battle, in order to accurately locate battle events and
check the accuracy of historic maps.  Trenches and field
fortifications are tangible artifacts of the passing of the
armies and often can be used to precisely locate the opposing
lines of battle.
<p>
<p>
In terms of understanding and interpreting history, it is
important to note that many contemporary battle reports were
often incomplete, flawed, or self-serving.  Eyewitnesses
sometimes differed so wildly that one cannot believe they are
describing the same event.  Many accounts need to be compared and
carefully weighed.  Often some small detail--a house site, a
stone fence, spring, ravine, or hillock--holds the key to
locating a unit's position.  Only close study of the terrain can
hope to reconcile such conflicting accounts.  Military historians
cannot understand or interpret a battle if the terrain has been
drastically altered.
<p>
<p>
The concept of ``battlefield as landscape'' places battlefield
preservation among the complex issues of regional planning,
farmland preservation, viewshed and watershed protection,
wildlife management, and the desire of many residents to preserve
open space in general.  As residents debate these issues and work
to establish a viable direction for the future, they should
consider battlefields as a valuable asset.  A battlefield,
despite the harsh memories that are often evoked, contributes to
the distinct identity and character of a community.  Battlefield
preservation can establish a link with the nation's past and
provide opportunities for attracting new businesses and visitors
to the area.  It is fair to say that, if it were not for their
battlegrounds, few people outside of Virginia would know of the
towns of Kernstown, Tom's Brook, Fisher's Hill, Piedmont, Port
Republic, or McDowell.  But the passing of history has changed
that.  For those who read history, these places are immortal.
