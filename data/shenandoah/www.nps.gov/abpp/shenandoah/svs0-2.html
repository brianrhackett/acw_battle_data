<B>Acknowledgments</B><p>
Of particular value to this study has been the work of Ms.
Maral<p>
Kalbian of the Frederick County Historical Society, who has
been<p>
conducting an architectural survey of Frederick, Clarke, and<p>
Warren counties over the past several years.  The extensive
files<p>
of the architectural survey were generously made available to<p>
researchers for this study.  These records are also filed at
the<p>
State Historic Preservation Office in Richmond.  It is hoped
that<p>
this initial study will provide impetus for further research
of<p>
this nature to document more fully the historic resources of
the<p>
Valley.<p>
<p>
Many people offered advice and assistance, and none should be<p>
slighted although they cannot all be mentioned.  We thank
Edwin<p>
C. Bearss and Jeffry Wert for their guidance and expertise in<p>
serving as the study's consulting historians.  Acknowledgement
