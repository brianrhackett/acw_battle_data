Confederate victory

Study Area

2,638.96 acres
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area to include the town of Granby,
from which Union forces marched to Newtonia, and the Confederate
approach from Camp Coffee (based on the findings of a 1995 archeological
survey funded by the ABPP). The Federal approach from a campsite
approximately three miles north of Newtonia was also added (Union reenforcements from Sarcoxie retreated to these camps, but their exact route
is not known and therefore not included on the map).
The ABPP expanded the Core Area to include the Confederate flanking
attack along the Granby Road, and the area bombarded by the Federal
artillery on the heights north and northwest of Newtonia.

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The battlefield is predominantly rural. Sections
have been altered, however, by residential development along
Highway 86, scattered agribusiness complexes associated with
large-scale corn production, and the construction of commercial
chicken houses. While these types of land uses will continue to
diminish the integrity of the historic landscape, they are slow to
occur. Newtonia I remains a good candidate for comprehensive
battlefield preservation.
Congress recently directed the National Park Service to study the
possibility of adding the Newtonia I and Newtonia II battlefields
to the National Park System (Public Law 110-229). The Newtonia
Battlefields Special Resource Study team will assess the national
significance of the battlefields using National Historic Landmark
criteria, and evaluate both the suitability and feasibility of
establishing an independent unit of the park system and the
desirability of adding it to Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield.
The study is ongoing and public comment is encouraged (please
visit http://parkplanning.nps.gov/newtonia for more information).
The study is expected to conclude in 2012.

Brigade, Provisional Cavalry Division, Department of Missouri [US];
Shelby’s Division, Army of Missouri [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

4,328.24 acres
The ABPP redrew the 1993 Study Area to include the ground (from
modern day Stark City to the historic Granby Road) over which Blunt’s and
Shelby’s forces fought, and to include the cornfields through which
Sanborn’s reinforcements pressed Shelby’s division. Also included is the
historic Granby Road, which both forces used at the beginning of the
battle (segments of the road are still discernable on the landscape). The
ABPP widened the Study Area to account for Confederate movements
from the northwest into Newtonia, movement along the Pineville Road
from Newtonia to the Confederate camp south of Newtonia, the
Confederate encampment area, and the Confederate route of withdrawal
from the camp to the south.
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Core Area significantly to take in the full
sweep of the general engagement between Blunt’s and Shelby’s forces
and the later engagement between Sanborn’s reinforcements and Shelby’s
division. The Core Area also now includes the position of the 1st Colorado
Battery on the bluffs northwest of Newtonia.

Study Area

1,387.58 acres
The 1993 Study Area was extended out to Roanoke, Missouri, where the
Federal expedition joined forces. The ABPP used satellite images of the
landscape to identify the "tortuous windings of a narrow road"
(Missouri Democrat, January 9th, 1862) on which the Federal force
travelled to Silver Creek.
The 1993 Core Area was reduced to focus on the location of fighting
directly south of Silver Creek and the location of the creek bed that
Confederate troops used as breastworks.

Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance. Longterm threats include coal-mining activities, soil erosion associated
with timbering operations, sporadic residential development
within the Study Area, and denser development associated with
the small towns of Yates and Roanoke and along Missouri
Highway B. Roan’s Tan Yard is a good candidate for
comprehensive battlefield preservation.

The ABPP revised the 1993 Study Area and lengthened the Federal
approach route along the Mt. Vernon Road to show troop movement
into the town of Springfield where the Federals intended to raise the
National Colors at the court house and drive out the remainder of the
Missouri State Guard.
The 1993 Core Area was reduced to the land directly paralleling the
Mt. Vernon Road (west of Jordan Creek) to represent the attempted
Confederate ambush along the road.

Study Area

11,179.39 acres (10,885.48 in Missouri; 293.91 acres in Kansas)
The 1993 Study Area boundaries did not include the October 23rd
action at Byram’s Ford. The CWSAC incorrectly included that action as
part of the Byram's Ford battlefield (MO026). The ABPP therefore
removed that action from MO026 and incorporated it into Westport
(MO027).
The ABPP made extensive revisions to the 1993 Study Area. The Study
Area now reflects the following: 1) the Federal approach route from
the east; 2) the action at Byram's Ford on October 23rd; 3) troop
movements to the east; 4) fighting to the west along and over the
Missouri-Kansas state line; 5) the movement of Price's wagon train to
the south from the Byram's Ford area; 6) retreats and advances over
open ground toward the Confederate wagon train; 7) skirmishing
toward, and the action at, Mockbee Farm; 8) the Confederate route to
and across Russell's Ford; 8) the skirmish south of Russell's Ford along
the Confederate route of withdrawal; and 9) the Confederate route of
withdrawal to the south (the boundary extends only as far as the
ABPP was able to identify the course of the historic road to Little
Santa Fe).
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Core Area to represent the following
areas of engagement: 1) fighting at Byram’s Ford on October 23rd; 2)
fighting north and south along Brush Creek; fighting to and along the
Missouri-Kansas state line; 3) heavy fighting as the Confederate forces
began to fall back from Westport (unwittingly) toward Pleasonton’s
division; and 4) Shelby's last defensive position along a series of stone
walls running east-west.
In addition, the ABPP established two new Core Areas. The central
Core Area represents the location of the Union attack near the
Confederate wagon train and the running battle across the landscape
to Mockbee Farm (this action is not to be confused with the Mockbee
Farm action on October 22nd). The southern Core Area represents the
Federal assault on the Confederate wagon train (which was repulsed).

Condition Statement

With the exception of lands around and immediately to the west
of Byram’s Ford, the landscape and terrain of this battlefield have
been altered beyond recognition since the period of significance.
The growth of Kansas City has subsumed the battlefield and it is
now an urban landscape. Other than the Byram’s Ford area, only
commemorative and interpretive opportunities exist for this
battlefield particularly in Big Blue Battlefield, Swope, and Loose

The ABPP made significant changes to the 1993 Study Area. The Study
Area was expanded to the east and south to incorporate land over
which Lieutenant Colonel Franz Sigel’s men advanced and carried out
their part in double envelopment of Price’s line; to the north to
incorporate Lyon’s line of approach and later withdrawal; and to the
west to represent Colonel Elkanah Greer’s Texas cavalry movements
and attack on Lyon’s right. The 1993 Core Area was narrowed and
lengthened to reflect the areas of fighting more accurately.

Condition Statement

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield preserves
two-fifths of the battlefield landscape. The private land
surrounding the National Battlefield is generally rural, although
that is beginning to change. In the last 10 years, large lot
residential development has moved into the eastern boundary of
the Study Area on both sides of the county line. Denser
residential subdivisions are also being built just to the northwest
of the Study Area, due to the battlefield’s proximity to Republic.
These new developments are approximately one mile from the
National Battlefield’s visitor center and less than one mile from
the Study Area boundary.
Conservation easements are emerging as a solution to Wilson’s
Creek’s development pressures. In 2003 and 2006, a local family
voluntarily placed conservation easements on 172 acres of their
land—historic battlefield land—beyond the Wilson’s Creek
National Battlefield’s boundary. A local land trust holds the
easements in perpetuity and monitors the condition of the
properties. Future voluntary easements can help stem the tide of
development in the Study Area and permanently protect those
portions of the historic landscape held in private ownership.
