Battle Date(s)

Principal Commanders

Major General John A. McClernand and Acting Rear Admiral David
D. Porter [US]; Brigadier General Thomas J. Churchill [CS]

Forces Engaged

Army of the Mississippi and a flotilla of the Mississippi River

Results

Union victory

Study Area

3,097.18 acres
The 1993 Study Area included lands associated with the Federal
flotilla’s movements toward Notrebes Landing prior to January 9.
That land was excised, reducing the Study Area to only land
associated with the events of January 9-11, 1863. The Study Area
was further revised to reflect the historic bend in the Arkansas
River.
The ABPP reduced the Core Area to identify more accurately the
area of the land engagement, the location of the gunboat assault,
and the placement of the Federal batteries built across the Arkansas
River from Fort Hindman.

Condition Statement

Natural changes in the course of the Arkansas River and
construction of the Arkansas Post Canal have altered portions of
the battlefield’s Core Area dramatically. About 360 acres of land
fought over on January 9, 1863, are now under water. A levee
extending from the canal down to Notrebes Bend and modernized
roads further diminish the integrity of the historic landscape.
Despite the presence of this infrastructure on the landscape, about
1,300 acres beyond the Arkansas Post National Memorial remain
rural and undeveloped, making the battlefield a good candidate
for additional protection.

Results

Union victory

Study Area

9,666.26 acres
The ABPP extended the Study Area to include the approach route of
the Federal infantry along the northern edge of the Arkansas River,
the Federal route of advance from Ashley's Mills to the city of Little
Rock, and the camps from which the Confederates moved to dig
their defensive positions.
The Core Area was reduced and cut into two areas. The eastern
Core Area represents the artillery duel and skirmishing that
preceded the Federal crossing of the Arkansas River. The western
Core Area represents the location of action against the Confederate
defensive line along Bayou Fourche, including Federal artillery
positions north of the Arkansas River that fired upon the
Confederate line.

Condition Statement

Most of this battlefield has been compromised by growth around
the City of Little Rock. The western half of the battlefield is now
dominated by the Little Rock National Airport and related
industrial development. Only the eastern portion of the battlefield
retains integrity as a cohesive landscape. Cultural resource and
archeological surveys are appropriate methods to determine if
battlefield features survive on land associated with the eastern
Core Area, which is currently being developed for lake-side
residences.

Forces Engaged

1st Cavalry Division, Department of the Missouri, Arkansas Expedition
[US]; Marmaduke’s Cavalry Division and Dobbins’ Arkansas

Result

Confederate victory

Study Area

3,220.59 acres
The CWSAC did not survey the Bayou Meto battlefield in 1993. The
newly drawn Study Area follows the historic Telegraph Road (now
Military Road) from Brownsville to Bayou Meto. Brownsville was
the base of operations for the Federal cavalry under Davidson. The
Study Area widens around the ridges east of the Bayou Meto
crossing to include the location of the intense skirmishing in this
area. The Study Area expands around Bayou Meto to represent the
position of Federal and Confederate skirmish lines.
The newly drawn Core Area begins were the Federal forces
deployed the entire 1st Cavalry Division into line of battle to drive
off the Confederate skirmishers in the hills. It also includes
Confederate artillery and infantry positions across Bayou Meto.

Condition Statement

Growth associated with the City of Jacksonville has destroyed most
of the northern half of the Core Area and residential and
commercial development along Military Road has diminished the
integrity of that historic corridor. The portions of this battlefield
that remain are under steady development pressure and should be
the focus of coordinated local, state, and national preservation
organizations.

Confederate tactical victory

Study Area

9,007.96 acres
The revised Study Area includes the starting point of the Federal
probing movement south toward Cane Hill, the starting point (Lee Creek
camp) of the Confederate probing movement north toward Cane Hill,
and the three engagement areas at Cane Hill, Fly Creek Valley, and Cove
Creek.
The Cane Hill Core Area was revised to include more positions of Federal
artillery. The Cove Creek Core Area was added to illustrate the location
of the Confederate ambush that decided the outcome of the battle.

Condition Statement

Most of the battlefield retains a high degree of integrity. All three
of the combat areas remain essentially undeveloped, and there is
little pressure to develop in this rural area. Cane Hill presents one
of the best opportunities in Arkansas for comprehensive
preservation of a battlefield landscape.

Results

Confederate tactical victory

Study Area

770.64 acres (217.07 acres in Arkansas; 554.45 acres in Missouri)
The ABPP narrowed and lengthened the Study Area along the Old
Military Road, the route taken by Federal forces as they pursued the
retreating Confederates after the action on May 1 on the Missouri
side of the St. Francis River.
The ABPP assigned a new Core Area for the action on May 1 and
reduced the Core Area at Chalk Bluff to the fields of fire between
opposing batteries.

Condition Statement

Most of the battlefield retains a high degree of integrity.
Scattered residential development along County Road 228
(Missouri) only slightly diminishes the character of the historic
landscape. Chalk Bluff presents an excellent opportunity for
comprehensive preservation of a battlefield landscape. Because
the majority of the land associated with this battle lies in Missouri,
interstate efforts to protect this battlefield are necessary.

Location

Sebastian County

Campaign

Operations to Control Indian Territory

Battle Date(s)

September 1, 1863

Principal Commanders

Colonel William F. Cloud [US]; Brigadier General William L. Cabell [CS]

Forces Engaged

2nd Kansas Cavalry, 6th Missouri Cavalry, two sections of Rabb’s
2nd Indiana Battery, and two mountain howitzers [US]; Cabell's
Brigade [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

2,538.32 acres
The ABPP narrowed the Study Area to follow more precisely the
retreat route used by Cabell’s troops. The Study Area was expanded
slightly around Old Jenny Lind to include the location of a skirmish
there on the morning of September 1, a preliminary attempt by the
Confederates to slow the Federal advance to Devil’s Backbone.
The Core Area was reduced in the east to better reflect the vicinity
of fighting along the roads used by the retreating Confederate
brigade.

Condition Statement

While portions of the battlefield have suffered from road
construction and development, most of the historic landscape
retains integrity. The landform of Devil’s Backbone is the primary
natural feature of the battlefield, and dominates the historic
setting. Rural and agricultural land uses prevail. In the long term,
preservation of the entire Core Area is feasible and should be the
focus of preservation efforts at this battlefield.
