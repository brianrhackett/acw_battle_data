Baton Rouge (LA003)
Location

East Baton Rouge Parish; West Baton Rouge Parish

Campaign

Confederate Offensive Against Baton Rouge (1862)

Battle Date(s)

August 5-6, 1862

Principal Commanders

Brigadier General Thomas Williams, Commander William D. Porter [US];
Major General John C. Breckinridge, Lieutenant Henry K. Stevens [CS]

Forces Engaged

Baton Rouge Garrison; Division of Flotilla in Western Waters [US];
Breckinridge’s Division; ram CSS Arkansas [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

15,564.21 acres
The Study Area was extended north to the approximate location of the
CSS Arkansas’s first breakdown, which kept the warship from arriving at
Baton Rouge on August 5 to support Breckinridge’s attack. The lower
Core Area encompasses the main battle on August 5th. The upper Core
Area is the location of the brief duel between the USS Essex and the CSS
Arkansas on August 6. The USS Essex had prevented the Arkansas from
“rendering further assistance to the land forces she was cooperating
with.” (Report of Commander W. D. Porter, Off Baton Rouge, August 6,
1862, in the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the
War of the Rebellion, Series I, Volume 19).

Condition Statement

The landscape and terrain of the battlefield have been altered
beyond recognition since the time of battle and the historic
landscape is no longer recognizable. A few scattered historic
structures (such as the Pentagon Barracks/Fort Williams) and sites
(such as Magnolia Cemetery) remain, but the modern city of
Baton Rouge has overtaken the historic landscape.
The course of the Mississippi River through Baton Rouge has been
channeled and engineered for flood control. Along the river’s
edge, the historic setting has been overwhelmed by urban and
heavy industrial development (north of the State Capitol). Much
of the land on the east side of the river is modern fill. Two
modern bridges now span the river: the Interstate 10 bridge at
the southern end of the battlefield Study Area and the US Route
140 bridge, which bisects the upper Core Area.
The battlefield of Baton Rouge provides opportunities for
commemoration, but few opportunities for cultural resource
preservation beyond what has been saved and maintained.

Campaign

Red River Campaign (1864)

Battle Date(s)

April 12, 1864

Principal Commanders

Brigadier General Thomas Kilby Smith, Lieutenant Commander
Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. [US]; Brigadier General Tom Green [CS]

Forces Engaged

Provisional Division, XVII Army Corps, USS Osage, USS Lexington,
and Army transports Vivian, Black Hawk, Meteor, Clara Bell, Rob
Roy, Hastings, and Emerald [US]; Green’s Cavalry Division [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

2,547.77 acres
The ABPP adjusted the Study Area to conform to the course of the
Red River c. 1864. Also, the ABPP added the approach route used by
BG Thomas Green’s Cavalry Division. Green was attempting to
intercept the Federal flotilla, which was slowly working its way
down the Red River. The Core Area reflects the nearly two-mile
front covered by the Federal gunboats and army transports as they
moved down the river.

town of Lake End continues to increase, threatening the integrity
of the landscape unaffected by the shifting river. Much of the
battlefield’s Core Area retains integrity, however, and should be
the focus of future protection efforts.

Study Area

3,610.11 acres
The revised Study Area illustrates the Federal squadron’s
movements north of Donaldsonville as it prepared to shell the town,
and the squadron’s subsequent movement away from the town.
The Core Area was widened slightly to accommodate the size of the
flotilla.

Condition Statement

The land portion of the battlefield—in and around Donaldsonville
itself—has lost integrity. The course and character of the
Mississippi River, however, do retain integrity in this location. No
opportunities for land protection remain, but opportunities to
interpret the naval bombardment of the town could be realized.

Donaldsonville II (LA013)
Location

Ascension Parish

Campaign

Taylor’s Operations in Louisiana West of Mississippi (1863)

Battle Date(s)

June 28, 1863

Principal Commanders

Major Joseph D. Bullen, Commander Melancthon B. Woolsey [US];
Brigadier General Tom Green [CS]

Forces Engaged

Fort Butler garrison and the USS Princess Royal, USS Winona, and USS
Kineo [US]; Detachments of Green's and Moutons's Texas Brigades [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

4,980.91 acres
The ABPP’s revised Study Area extends up the Mississippi River to
take in the approach of the Federal gun boats, which were
steaming to the aid of the Fort Butler garrison. The southern
approach represents the Confederate advance from the point where
Green deployed his troops for a two-pronged attack on the fort.
The Core Area was expanded to include the naval bombardment
from the river.

Unlike the naval action at Donaldsonville in August 1862, the river
plays a much smaller role in this battle. Therefore, the ABPP did not
draw a PotNR boundary within the Mississippi River because it does
not convey the significance of the land attack on Fort Butler.
