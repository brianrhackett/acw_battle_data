The ABPP revised the 1993 Study Area to include the Confederate
approach route from the Old Fair Grounds, the area around
Machpelah Cemetery (see below), the location of Price’s headquarters,
and the areas in which the Confederate army maneuvered.
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Core Area to include the locations of the
Confederate batteries on the heights and in town that bombarded
the Federal fortifications. A second, new Core Area was drawn
around Machpelah Cemetery. Here Union pickets stood their ground
against Price’s cavalry and infantry while the Union defenders
completed their entrenchments at College Hill. When Price’s artillery
arrived, the Union pickets fell back to the finished works.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. The growth of the City of Lexington has
destroyed most of the battlefield. Only the Battle of Lexington State
Historic Site protects significant historic resources and land associated
with the battle. Portions of undeveloped, privately owned land
surround the state historic site. Historic landscape and archeological
studies on those lands should be undertaken to determine if any
significant subsurface battle features or historic terrain features
survive on those parcels.
The Machpelah Cemetery, established in 1849 by the Missouri
Legislature, has expanded well beyond its battle-period boundaries.
As an open area, however, it provides an excellent venue for public
interpretation of the early stages of the battle.

routes from the east, and the routes of withdrawal used by Union and
Confederate forces to the west (the routes of withdrawal end at a
road intersection described in the reports of the engagement found in
The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the
Union and Confederate Armies).
The ABPP reduced the 1993 Core Area slightly in the north and south
to illustrate more accurately where fighting occurred. The Core Area
was extended to the west to reflect the extent of the fighting during
the Federal retreat.

Little information is available about this battle. The ABPP was unable
to verify the precise location of Blue Mills Landing, where the general
engagement began. Historical sources do agree that Union forces
retreated to Liberty and used the William Jewel College as a hospital
for their wounded. The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area to
include the college and narrowed the route of approach. The ABPP
also narrowed the 1993 Core Area because it could find no evidence
that Confederate units fired from across the river.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. Modern development and industrial
activity has destroyed much of the historic landscape within the
Study Area. The Core Area; however, retains good integrity.
Located eight miles northeast of Kansas City in Clay County, the
battlefield is now used for residential subdivisions and various
industrial activities within the old bend of the Missouri River.
Highway 291 and Highway 210 crisscross the battlefield, as do
numerous other local roads and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe
and Norfolk Southern railroads. Some portions of prairie survive
west of Highway 291, but they are isolated from the rest of the
battlefield by industrial plants, abandoned mines, and major
roads. Dense residential development has grown up around
Highway 291 south of Liberty. Finally, even though the historic
river bend is still identifiable, the shifting of the Missouri River,
significantly diminishes the landscape's integrity. Further
residential development south of Liberty and expanding industrial
development around South Liberty (recent development there
includes the Fountain Bluff Sports Complex) and the community
of River Bend are immediate threats to the battlefield Core Area.

The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area to include the Confederate
route of approach from the east, the point of initial contact between
the opposing forces, the area of fighting across the Little Blue River,
the area of fighting west of the river, areas of troop movements
throughout the day, and the path of the fight to and through
Independence. The ABPP was unable to identify the roads upon
which Union forces completed their withdrawal toward Westport.
The ABPP redrew the 1993 Core Area to represent more fully the day’s
fighting. Included are 1) the location of the opening engagement
east of the Little Blue River; 2) the sweep of fighting along and across
the river; 3) the location of fighting across farmland to the west of the
river; 4) the location where the Union battle line reformed once Blunt
arrived on the field from Independence; 5) the area of the Union
counterattack back toward the river; 6) the Confederate
counterattack back to the west; 6) the fighting retreat made by of
Union forces to Independence; and 7) the street fighting in town.

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. The only portion of the battlefield that
retains integrity is a section of approximately 2,500 acres along
the Little Blue River. The Little Blue River runs close to its historic
course. The Lawson Moore House—used as a hospital during the
battle—still stands. The rock outcropping used by Union troops as
a defensive position survives in places, and traces of the
Independence-Lexington Road are still discernable on the landscape.
Urban and suburban development associated with the growth of the City
of Independence has destroyed the remainder of the battlefield.

The Union Pacific Railroad cuts through the battlefield, as does US
Route 24.
The portion of the battlefield that survives is imminently
threatened by the construction of the Little Blue Parkway (a 4-lane
principal artery) and the expected development that will follow.
The City of Independence is currently constructing a portion of the
Little Blue Parkway from US 78 north to East Bundschu Road, the
southern boundary of the battlefield. As of November 2010, land
within the battlefield between East Bundschu Road and US 24 was
being acquired for road construction (City of Independence, Public
Works, http://www.ci.independence.mo.us/publicworks/
displaydetails.aspx?id=339). The surviving 2,500 acres should be

targeted for immediate preservation.

Confederate camps, approach route, and retreat route associated with
the action on the 16th. The Study Area was also adjusted to
accommodate a new Core Area (see below).
The 1993 Core Area was amended to reflect more accurately the size
of the engagement south of Lone Jack and to include the location
where Federal forces fought to break away from the battle on the
east side of the battlefield. South of the original Core Area, the ABPP
mapped a new Core Area to represent the area of the Federal attack
on Colonel Coffee's camp on the 15th.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving some
essential features. Less than 1,000 contiguous acres of the battlefield
remain. Much of the battlefield around the town of Lone Jack falls
within an Urban Service District of Jackson County. Land adjacent to
the Urban Service District is zoned for suburban development. [Jackson
County, Missouri, Department of Public Works, “Development Diagram,”
http://www.jacksongov.org/filestorage/2494/2498/Map-4-DevelopmentDiagram03-13-2007.pdf, March 2007.] Since 1993, portions of the battlefield have

been developed for commercial uses, notably fast food restaurants, gas
stations, and strip malls. The historic East Field is now a subdivision,
and a new high school sits immediately south of the East Field Core
Area. The historic West Field is still used for cropland, but it is zoned
and marketed for commercial use. The only protected land on the
battlefield is a three-acre parcel owned by the county, which includes
three burial trenches and a small museum (both maintained by the
Lone Jack Historical Society). Immediate preservation efforts are
needed to save the last bits of historic terrain associated with the
battle.

The 1993 Study Area and Core Area were both drawn on an east-west
alignment. The fighting actually occurred from north to south. The
ABPP therefore realigned the 1993 tudy Area and Core Area
boundaries and removed the mapping inaccuracies. The Study Area
was further modified to include the location where Confederate
forces forded the Marmiton River, and the area south of the river
where Price abandoned a large portion of his wagon train. No
approach routes could be identified definitively: the military road no
longer exists. Similarly, the ABPP was unable to identify the
Confederate route of withdrawal south of the river on the modern
landscape.

Land use is little changed since the period of significance. Overall,
the topography of the landscape has changed little since the time
of the battle. Farmland and woodlots have replaced the open
prairie of the Civil War period, and roads and railroads did, or do,
crisscross the battlefield, but otherwise the area appears to be
undeveloped. Marmiton River presents an excellent opportunity
for protection of the entire battlefield landscape.

and residential use along Highway OO between Hallsville and Mount
Zion Church. [Boone County Department of Planning and Building,
11/26/2010, http://www.showmeboone.com/PB/]. Increased residential
development is the primary threat to the surviving portions of the
battlefield. If construction of new homes, roads, and associated
infrastructure is not stemmed and protective measures are not taken to
set aside battlefield land, what remains of the battlefield will quickly
become fractured and unable to convey the story of the battle.

Study Area

55,952.28 acres (30,406.72 acres in Missouri; 15,114.14 acres in
Tennessee; 10,431.42acres in Kentucky)
Although the CWSAC surveyed New Madrid/Island No. 10, they did
not deliniate Study or Core Area boundaries.
The Federal naval and land operations against the Confederate
garrisons at Island No. 10 and New Madrid took five weeks to
complete. The reduction of those garrisons opened the Mississippi
River to Federal control as far as Fort Pillow, near Memphis,
Tennessee. The boundaries of the battlefield reflect that entire
operation.
The new Study Area was drawn to follow the 1862 path of the
Mississippi River while also incorporating the locations of multiple
batteries, fortifications, and landing points constructed along the river
by both Confederate and Union forces. The Union Navy's point of
anchorage below Island No. 8 was used as the starting point for the
boundary on the river. The Union Army’s overland approach from
Sikeston is also included. The towns of Point Pleasant and Tiptonville
are included in the Study Area because both were fortified by the
Confederates and later taken by Union forces during the operations
around Island No. 10.
There are five Core Areas.
• The Core Area for the defense of the town of New Madrid (March
3–14, 1862) includes the Confederate batteries (which provided
supporting fire) located across the river, and the positions of
Confederate gunboats off New Madrid.
• The Core Area below New Madrid and the Core Area off Point
Pleasant represent the locations of Federal land batteries and the
locations where Federal infantry engaged Confederate gunboats
and Confederate batteries across the river (March 7-13, 1862).
The Core Area below New Madrid also includes the area
bombarded by the naval ironclads USS Carondelet and the USS
Pittsburgh (April 7, 1862).
• The Core Area at Island No. 10 includes the area of heavy
bombardment on the island and its supporting fortifications; the
location of the Union Navy's raid against the upper fortifications
on the Tennessee side of the river; and the running of the
batteries by the USS Carondelet and the USS Pittsburgh (March
15-April 8, 1862).

• The southernmost Core Area, below Riddles Point, represents the
engagement between the Federal land batteries of Brigadier
General John M. Palmer’s division and Confederate gunboats
(March 16, 1862). Palmer’s batteries prevented Confederate reenforcements from joining the battle at Island No. 10.

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. The battlefield landscape is
predominantly rural, but changes in the course of the Mississippi
River have dramatically altered the topography within the
floodplain and have likely washed away significant archeological
signatures associated with the battle. Manmade intrusions on the
historic landscape include an extensive system of levees, industrial
development on the bank of the Mississippi River east of Marston,
and growth around the towns of New Madrid, Tiptonville, and
Point Pleasant. Despite these changes, the ABPP calculates that
about 37,000 acres retain integrity. The ABPP recommends that
future archeological studies be undertaken throughout the Study
Area to determine if and where battle signatures survive. In the
