Condition Statement

Portions of the battlefield have been altered, but most essential
landscape and historic features remain. The Droop Mountain
Battlefield State Park was dedicated in 1928. In the 90 years since,
no other portion of the battlefield has been protected. Beyond
the boundaries of the state park, private development of
battlefield land for vacation and retirement homes is beginning to
affect the historic landscape.
Concerted efforts are needed to protect the remaining battlefield
within the next 10 years.
