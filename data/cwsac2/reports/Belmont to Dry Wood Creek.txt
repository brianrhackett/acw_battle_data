Study Area

4,502.29 acres (3,136.89 acres in Missouri; 1,365.40 acres in
Kentucky)
The revised Study Area represents the Mississippi river’s course as it flowed
in 1861 and includes expanded boundaries that incorporate the US naval
movements on the river. The ABPP also expanded the Study Area to
include the location where Confederate reinforcements crossed the river
from Columbus, Kentucky; the fortifications near Columbus known as the
“Iron Bluffs;” and the 27th Illinois Infantry’s route of withdrawal to the
army’s landing point on the river (the 27th became separated from the
main Union force during the battle).
The ABPP also expanded the Core Area to represent the range of
Confederate guns firing from the “Iron Bluffs” and the range of the guns
on board the USS Tyler and the USS Lexington, which provided covering
fire for the Federal retreat.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The Missouri portion of the battlefield is rural
and mostly cropland. The Mississippi river has not altered its
course much here since the Civil War, which allows for a higher
degree of landscape integrity than at battlefields where
meandering waterways have wiped out defining features, altered
terrain, and confused modern interpretation. There are no known
threats to the battlefield on the Missouri side. On the Kentucky
side, Kentucky State Parks protects 160 acres, including the
Confederate earthworks. Belmont provides an excellent
opportunity for comprehensive landscape protection over the long
term.

Study Area

2,405.72 acres
The ABPP modified the 1993 Study Area to add the route of the
Federal approach from the Missouri River and the route of the
Confederate retreat towards the town of Boonville.
The 1993 Core Area was shortened slightly to represent the actual
location of Camp Bacon. The ABPP also added two new Core Areas.
The first represents the location of a Confederate battery along the
river that was bombarded by the Union Army transport’s artillery. The
second Core Area represents the Confederate camp on the outskirts of
town that also received fire from the transport’s artillery.

Study Area

3,353.35 acres
The 1993 Study Area and Core Area did not accurately reflect the full
extent of the battlefield landscape. The ABPP redrew the Study Area
to include: 1) the Confederate approach from the east, 2) Confederate
movements along the Big Blue River (these movements caused Union
forces to eventually withdraw from the Byram's Ford area), 3) fighting
to the immediate east and west of Byram's Ford, 4) the Confederate
flanking movement from the north, and 5) the fighting retreat of
Union forces west toward the Missouri-Kansas state line.
The Core Area includes the locations of frontal assaults on Byram's
Ford, the left flank attack by Confederate forces on the Union lines,
and the organized fighting withdrawal from the Byram's Ford area to
within a quarter mile of the Missouri-Kansas state line.

Condition Statement

The landscape of the battlefield has been severely altered since
the period of significance. The growth of Kansas City has
subsumed the battlefield and, with the exception of lands within
the easternmost portion of the Core Area, the majority of Byram’s
Ford is now an urban landscape. Kansas City Parks and Recreation
preserves part of the battlefield as the Big Blue Battlefield Park
and has been working with the Monnett Battle of Westport Fund,
Inc. on acquisition, preservation and interpretive opportunities for
the battlefield, concentrating on the Park and battlefield lands
between the Big Blue River and Elmwood Avenue. While an
archeological survey was completed on a portion of the battlefield
in 1997, future archeological surveys should be undertaken on the
remaining open space to determine if and where defining
features (such as road traces) and battle signatures survive.

Results

Study Area

6,292.22 acres (5,276.9 acres in Missouri; 1,015.33acres in Illinois)
The revised 1993 Study Area includes the approach route of Union reenforcements traveling along the Mississippi River and the Confederate
approach routes along the Jackson, Perryville, and Bloomfield Roads. The
exact route of the Confederate retreat from Jackson Road towards
Bloomfield is not known and, for that reason, was not added. The ABPP
reduced the 1993 Core Area boundary to areas of skirmishing on Jackson
Road and the fields of fire of the multiple batteries engaged.

Confederate victory

Study Area

9,209.83 acres
The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area in the north to include the
Confederate and Union lines above Double Trouble Creek. The Study
Area boundary was also narrowed slightly to account for the fact that
most of the action associated with this running engagement closely
followed the roads. The 1993 Core Areas have been adjusted to
reflect the ranges of artillery employed during this battle.
In addition to the 1993 Core Areas, two new Core Areas were added.
The first is located north of Double Trouble Creek and represents the
battle’s opening artillery duel. The second was added at the southern
end of the battlefield to account for fighting within Carthage and to
the east of town.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The growth of the City of Carthage has
destroyed the southern portion of the battlefield, but much of the
battlefield to the north of the city retains integrity. The Battle of
Carthage State Historic Site protects 7.40 acres on the eastern
edge of the city, but the land is isolated from the rest of the
battlefield. North of the city, active mining continues to destroy
Core Area land, as has the recent construction of the US 71 bypass
through the portions of the battlefield at Kendricktown. Ordnuff
Hill, where Sigel's artillery fired on Rains' division to slow its
advance and allow the Federal wagons time to cross the Spring
River at Walker's Ford, has been destroyed by mining operations
(the hill is now called Quarry Hill). Surviving land within this Core
Area should be targeted for immediate preservation. Long-term
preservation efforts should focus on protecting the battlefield
landscape north of Kendricktown that retains good integrity.

Study Area

4,306.18 acres
The CWSAC did not establish complete Study and Core Areas for
Clark’s Mill in 1993. The newly drawn Study Area includes the
Confederate advance along the creek bed of Bryant's Creek, and the
Union retreat from Bryant's Creek along the Old Vera Cruz Road to
Vera Cruz and the blockhouses at Clark's Mill.
The lower Core Area represents the drive of the Confederate
vanguard south of Vera Cruz along Bryant's Creek. The upper Core
Area represents the artillery duel and skirmishing around Clark's Mill
itself.

The 1993 Study Area for Dry Wood Creek originally included two
separated parts. Based on new research, the ABPP determined that
no fighting associated with this battle occurred in the eastern
segment. Thus, that portion of the Study Area was removed. The
ABPP also adjusted the Study Area to take in the breadth of the creek,
a defining feature of the battlefield. The Core Area was reduced
slightly to more accurately follow topographic features.
