Introduction
The information in this report fulfills, in part, the purposes of the Civil War Battlefield
Preservation Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-359, 111 Stat. 3016). Those purposes are:
1) to act quickly and proactively to preserve and protect nationally
significant Civil War battlefields through conservation easements and
fee-simple purchases of those battlefields from willing sellers; and
(2) to create partnerships among state and local governments, regional
entities, and the private sector to preserve, conserve, and enhance
nationally significant Civil War battlefields.
The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002 directs the Secretary of the Interior,
acting through the American Battlefield Protection Program of the National Park
Service, to update the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission (CWSAC) Report on the
Nation’s Civil War Battlefields. The CWSAC was established by Congress in 1991 and
published its report in 1993. Congress provided funding for this update in FY2005 and
FY2007. Congress asked that the updated report reflect the following:
•
•
•

Preservation activities carried out at the 384 battlefields identified by the
CWSAC during the period between 1993 and the update;
Changes in the condition of the battlefields during that period; and
Any other relevant developments relating to the battlefields during that
period.

In accordance with the legislation, this report presents information about Civil War
battlefields in Kentucky for use by Congress, federal, state, and local government
agencies, landowners, and other interest groups. Other state reports will be issued as
surveys and analyses are completed.

Synopsis
There are 11 CWSAC battlefields in Kentucky. Active preservation in Kentucky since the
early 1990s has resulted in a significant increase in protected lands at three battlefields:
Mill Springs, Perryville, and Richmond. The CWSAC ranked these three battlefields
among the nation’s top priorities for preservation in 1993. As a result, all three have
received local, state, and federal attention and assistance. These sites represent
successful, sustained efforts to protect historic battlefield lands. While significant
portions of these battlefields are protected, further work is still necessary to protect
remaining portions of their historic landscapes during the next decade.
The battlefields of Camp Wildcat, Cynthiana, Munfordville, and Rowlett’s Station
need more help today than they did in 1993. Residential development is now occurring
at the edges of all four. Land and cultural resource protection at these sites should be
the focus of intensified local, state, and federal battlefield preservation efforts in
Kentucky during the next three years.
The four other battlefields in Kentucky have experienced little change in condition
since 1993. However, only rural Middle Creek offers the opportunity for continuing
preservation of its historic landscape during the next 10 years. The battlefields of Ivy
Mountain, Paducah, and Barbourville are either severely fragmented (only remnant
landscape or cultural features of the battle survive) or destroyed due to significant
changes in land use since the time of the battle. These battlefields provide
opportunities for commemoration, but few opportunities for cultural resource
preservation.
Table 1 indicates how the CWSAC prioritized Kentucky’s Civil War battlefields in 1993.
The National Park Service will issue updated priorities after all of the CWSAC
battlefields nationwide have been surveyed and all state reports have been completed.

Method Statement
Congress instructed the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the American
Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP), to report on changes in the condition of the
battlefields since 1993 and on “preservation activities” and “other relevant
developments” carried out at each battlefield since 1993. To fulfill those assignments,
the ABPP 1) conducted site surveys of each battlefield and 2) prepared and sent out
questionnaires to battlefield managers and advocacy organizations (see Appendix B).

Research and Field Surveys
The ABPP conducted the field assessments of Kentucky battlefields in October and
November 2005. The surveys entailed additional historical research, on-the-ground
documentation and assessment of site conditions, identification of impending threats
to each site, and site mapping. Surveyors used a Global Positioning System (GPS) to
map historic features of each battlefield and used a Geographic Information System
(GIS) to draw site boundaries. The ABPP retains all final survey materials. Each
battlefield survey file includes a survey form (field notes, list of defining features, list of
documentary sources, and a photo log), photographs, spatial coordinates of significant
features, and boundaries described on USGS topographic maps. The surveys did not
include archeological investigations for reasons of time and expense.
Study Areas and Core Areas
The CWSAC identified a Study Area and a Core Area for each principal battlefield (see
Figure 2). The CWSAC boundaries have proven invaluable as guides to local land and
resource preservation efforts at Civil War battlefields. However, since 1993, the
National Park Service has refined its battlefield survey techniques, which include
research, working with site stewards, identifying and documenting lines of approach
and withdrawal used by opposing forces, and applying the concepts of military terrain
analysis to all battlefield landscapes. The ABPP’s Battlefield Survey Manual explains the
field methods employed during this study.1 The surveys also incorporate the concepts
recommended in the National Register of Historic Places’ Guidelines for Identifying,
Evaluating, and Registering America’s Historic Battlefields, which was published in 1992
after the CWSAC had completed its original assessments of the battlefields.
Using its refined methodology, ABPP was able to validate or adjust the CWSAC’s Study
Area and Core Area boundaries to reflect more accurately the full nature and original
resources of these battlefields (see Table 2). At all 11 battlefields in Kentucky, the
refined methodology resulted in significant increases in the size of Study Areas, Core
Areas, or both. However, it is important to note that the Study Area and Core Area
boundaries are simply historical boundaries that describe where the battle took place;
neither indicates the current integrity of the battlefield landscape, so neither can be
used on its own to identify surviving portions of battlefield land that may merit
protection and preservation.

Potential National Register
Boundaries
Federal, state, and local governments,
citizens, and historic preservation
advocates need site integrity
information when making funding,
treatment, and management decisions
about historic sites. In order to
address the question of what part of
the battlefield remains reasonably
intact and warrants preservation, this
study introduced a third boundary line
that was not attempted by the
CWSAC: the Potential National
Register boundary (see Figure 2).
The Potential National Register
(PotNR) boundary represents an
assessment of a battlefield’s current
integrity. Surveyors assigned PotNR
boundaries only when they judged
that enough of the battlefield remains
to convey its significance. In a few
cases, the PotNR boundary will
encompass the entire Study Area. In
most cases, however, the PotNR
boundary encompasses less land than
identified in the Study Area.

Figure 2: Boundary Definitions
The Study Area represents the historic extent of
the battle as it unfolded across the landscape.
The Study Area contains resources known to
relate to or contribute to the battle event: where
troops maneuvered, deployed, and fought
immediately before, during, and after combat.
Historic accounts, terrain analysis, and feature
identification inform the delineation of the
Study Area boundary. The Study Area indicates
the extent to which historic and archeological
resources associated with the battle (areas of
combat, command, communications, logistics,
medical services, etc.) may be found and
protected. Surveyors delineated Study Area
boundaries for every battle site that was
positively identified through research and field
survey, regardless of its present integrity.
The Core Area represents the areas of fighting
on the battlefield. Positions that delivered or
received fire fall within the Core Area.
Frequently described as “hallowed ground,” land
within the Core Area is often the first to be
targeted for protection. The Core Area lies
within the Study Area.
Unlike the Study and Core Areas, which are
based only upon the interpretation of historic
events, the Potential National Register
(PotNR) boundary represents an assessment of a
Study Area’s current integrity (the remaining
landscape and features that survive to convey
the site’s historic sense of place). Because it is
based on current integrity, the PotNR boundary
may include all or some of the Study Area, and
all, some, or none of the Core Area. Lands
assigned PotNR boundaries should be considered
worthy of further attention, although future
evaluations may reveal more or less integrity
than indicated by the ABPP surveys.

Surveyors followed National Register
of Historic Places guidelines when
identifying and mapping areas that
retain integrity at the battlefields.2
The PotNR boundary, however, does
not constitute a formal
determination of eligibility by the
Keeper of the National Register of
Historic Places.3 The PotNR
boundary is designed to be used as a
planning tool for government
agencies and the public. Like the
Study and Core Area boundaries, the
PotNR boundary places no restriction on private property use.

For general guidance about integrity issues and National Register properties, see National Park Service, How to Apply the
National Register Criteria for Evaluation (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the Interior, revised 1997). The survey
evaluations described above do not meet the more stringent integrity standards for National Historic Landmark designation.
See National Park Service, How to Prepare National Historic Landmark Nominations (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the
Interior, 1999), 36-37.

The term integrity, as defined by the National Register of Historic Places, is “the ability
of a property to convey its significance.”5 While assessments of integrity are subjective,
battlefields can have integrity only if they can be positively located through research
and ground-truthing and if significant portions of the landscape’s historic terrain have
not been substantially disturbed. Other conditions contribute to the degree of
integrity a battlefield retains:
1) battle-period resources (e.g., buildings, roads, fence lines, military
structures, and archeological features) and historic patterns of
interconnecting spaces and relationships between and among those
resources survive;
2) land use of the battlefield remains similar to battle-period land
use; and
3) the battlefield’s physical features and overall character enable
understanding of how the combatants moved through the landscape
by associating surviving features with historical accounts of the
battle.
Natural changes in vegetation—woods succeeding historic farm fields, for example—do
not necessarily diminish the landscape’s integrity. Significant changes in land use since
the Civil War do affect integrity; the degree to which post-war development has
altered and fragmented the historic landscape and destroyed historic features is critical
when assessing integrity. However, some post-battle development is expected; slight
or moderate change within the battlefield may not substantially diminish a battlefield’s
integrity.
The Potential National Register boundaries therefore indicate which battlefields are
likely eligible for future listing in the National Register of Historic Places and likely
deserving of future preservation efforts. If a surveyor determined that a battlefield
was entirely compromised by land use incompatible with the preservation of historic
features (i.e., it has little or no integrity), it did not receive a PotNR boundary. In cases
where a battlefield was already listed in the National Register, surveyors were asked to
reassess the existing documentation based on current scholarship and resource
integrity, and, when appropriate, to provide new information and propose new
boundaries as part of the surveys. As a result, some PotNR boundaries will contain
lands already listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In other cases, PotNR
boundaries will exclude previously listed lands that have lost integrity.

Register.

The data from which all three boundaries are drawn do not necessarily reflect the full
research needed for a formal National Register nomination. Potential National
Register boundaries are based on an assessment of aboveground historic features
associated with the cultural and natural landscape. The surveys did not include a
professional archeological inventory or assessment of subsurface features or
indications. In some cases, future archeological testing will help determine whether
subsurface features remain, whether subsurface battle features convey important
information about a battle or historic property, and whether that information may
help to confirm, refine, or refute the boundaries previously determined by historic
studies and terrain analysis.
The ABPP survey information should be reassessed during future compliance processes
such as the Section 106 process required by the National Historic Preservation Act7 and
Environmental Impact Statements/Environmental Assessments required by the National
Environmental Policy Act.8 Likewise, more detailed research and integrity assessments
should take place when any battlefield is formally nominated to the National Register
or proposed for designation as a National Historic Landmark. New research and
intensive-level surveys of these sites will enlighten future preservation and compliance
work. Agencies should continue to consult local and state experts for up-to-date
information about these battlefields.
Seven Kentucky battlefields are already listed in the National Register or are
designated National Historic Landmarks (see Table 4). At six of these listed battlefields,

the PotNR boundary expands upon the existing National Register boundary. At
Perryville, surveys recommend a smaller PotNR boundary than the existing National
Historic Landmark boundary because portions of the battlefield have been converted
from open, agricultural lands to residential lots. Rowlett’s Station battlefield is not
currently listed in the National Register, but it does appear eligible for listing. Three
battlefields—Barbourville, Ivy Mountain, and Paducah--do not appear to have
sufficient physical integrity to warrant a PotNR boundary. At no battlefield in
Kentucky is the recommended PotNR boundary as large as the Study Area, indicating
that a considerable amount of historic landscape has disappeared since the Civil War.
Camp Wildcat retains the most intact land within its Study Area: 80.38%.

Questionnaires
While the ABPP maintains data about its own program activities at Civil War
battlefields, most preservation work occurs at the local level. Therefore, to carry out
the Congressional directive for information about activities at the battlefields, the
ABPP sought input from local battlefield managers and advocacy organizations. The
ABPP distributed questionnaires designed to gather information about the types of
preservation activities that have taken place at the battlefields since 1993. The
Questionnaire is reproduced in Appendix B.
In Kentucky, representatives of seven organizations completed and returned the
questionnaires. Their responses, combined with the survey findings, allowed the ABPP
to create a profile of conditions and activities at Kentucky’s Civil War battlefields.

Summary of Conditions of Kentucky’s Civil War Battlefields
Quantified Land Areas
Using Geographic Information Systems, the ABPP calculated the amount of land
historically associated with the battle (Study Area), the amount of land where forces
were engaged (Core Area), and the amount of land that may retain enough integrity
to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and that remains to
be protected (Potential National Register boundary).
As noted above and as Table 2 illustrates, Study Areas and Core Areas have been
revised in many cases. In particular, the original CWSAC surveys did not consistently
include routes of approach and withdrawal or secondary actions that influenced the
course or outcome of the battle. The revised boundaries take these movements and
actions into account. In some instances, new or additional research has sharpened our
understanding of battle events. Therefore, the ABPP determined that additional lands
belonged appropriately in the Study and Core Areas because they lend additional
understanding to the battle story. Please see the individual battlefield profiles at the
end of this report for more information about the extent of and reasons for any
revisions to the CWSAC Study Area and Core Area boundaries.

Condition Assessments
Using field survey data, the ABPP assessed the overall condition of each battlefield’s
Study Area. While no battlefield remains completely unaltered since the Civil War,
more than half of Kentucky’s battlefields have experienced relatively little or only
moderate changes to their terrain and aboveground battle features in nearly 150
years.9

Registration
The Secretary of the Interior designates National Historic Landmarks (NHL) – nationally
significant historic sites – because they possess exceptional value or quality in
illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. The National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) is the nation’s official list of cultural sites significant at the
national, state, or local level and worthy of preservation. Federal and state agencies
use information from the National Register as a planning tool to identify and make
decisions about cultural resources. Properties listed on the National Register are also
eligible for numerous federal and state historic preservation grant programs.
Recognition as a NHL or NRHP battlefield also advances public understanding of and
appreciation for the battlefield, and encourages advocacy for its preservation.
Registered battlefields meet national standards for documentation, physical integrity,
and demonstrable significance to the history of our nation.
As Table 4 indicates, seven Kentucky battlefields are already designated as NHLs or
listed in the NRHP. Only two battlefields, Perryville and Camp Wildcat, were
registered prior to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission’s study of battlefields in the
early 1990s. The others were listed during or after the CWSAC study. Of the four

battlefields not listed or designated, only one, Rowlett’s Station, potentially retains
enough of its historic landscape to be eligible under the current criteria for listing.
The boundaries of those battlefields already designated or listed include more than
13,100.00 acres. Surveys conducted during this study indicate that additional lands – a
total of about 3,500.00 acres – may be eligible to add to the existing NHL and NRHP
listings. Table 4 compares the number of acres already designated or listed with the
number of acres that are likely to meet the same criteria, but are not currently part of
the existing NHL or NRHP boundary.

Stewardship
In Kentucky, nonprofit organizations have led efforts to preserve Civil War battlefields,
often in partnership with the Kentucky Heritage Council (the state historic preservation
office). Of the eight battlefields where the historic landscape remains largely or
somewhat intact, five – Middle Creek, Mill Springs, Munfordville, Perryville, and
Rowlett’s Station – have nonprofit stewards. These stewards often have leveraged
state or federal funds to purchase their holdings, but have retained control of the lands
themselves. In comparison, the Federal government and the Commonwealth of
Kentucky each own portions of only one battlefield. The USDA Forest Service and the
14
Update to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation’s Civil War Battlefields
Final DRAFT - Commonwealth of Kentucky

Laurel County Fiscal Court together control most of Camp Wildcat. The State owns
significant portions of the Perryville battlefield. The Madison County Fiscal Court,
which holds 597.00 acres at the Richmond battlefield, is the most prominent municipal
battlefield landowner in Kentucky. Among the eight battlefields retaining some
integrity, only Cynthiana is entirely in private, unprotected ownership.
Two of the three badly fragmented battlefields, Ivy Mountain and Barbourville, are
recognized by small public holdings established to commemorate the battles. At Ivy
Mountain, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established a one-acre wayside that
includes a monument dedicated in 2001 to honor the battle’s participants. At
Barbourville, the city recently set aside 0.25 acres for interpretive displays about the
battle. No historic land is protected at Paducah, but the battle is commemorated
through interpretive markers.
In addition, the Kentucky Heritage Council holds preservation easements at
Munfordville, Perryville, and Richmond. As part of its stewardship responsibilities
as an easement holder, the Council periodically monitors each battlefield to ensure no
changes incompatible with preservation and interpretation are made to the easement
properties.

Public Access and Interpretation
In its questionnaire, the ABPP asked battlefield stewards about the types of public
access and interpretation available at the battlefield. The ABPP did not collect
information about the purpose or intent of the interpretation and access, such as
whether a wayside exhibit was developed for purely educational reasons, to promote
heritage tourism, or boost local economic development.
The ABPP asked respondents to indicate the type of interpretation available at or
about the battlefield. The categories included brochures, driving tours, living history
demonstrations, maintained historic features or areas, walking tours and trails, wayside
exhibits, websites, and other specialized programs. The results indicate that all of
Kentucky’s Civil War battlefields currently provide some degree of public interpretation
and educational opportunities.

Local Advocacy
Nonprofit organizations play important roles in protecting historic battlefields.
Nonprofit organizations step in to preserve historic sites when public funding and
management for historic preservation are absent. When public funding is available,
nonprofits serve as vital partners in public-private preservation efforts, acting as
conduits for public funds, raising critical private matching funds, keeping history and
preservation in the public eye, and working with landowners to find ways to protect
battlefield parcels. Kentucky battlefields have several well-organized and visionary
local groups that have built and maintained relationships with all levels of government,
most notably the Kentucky Heritage Council, and other battlefield stakeholders.
The nonprofit friends groups identified in Table 7 are recognized as organizations
dedicated solely to the preservation, interpretation, and promotion of a specific
battlefield or battlefields. All of the organizations listed in Table 7 formed or
incorporated during or after the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission’s study of the
early 1990s. The federal effort to call attention to Kentucky’s battlefields was well
received and acted upon in the Commonwealth. Other organizations with more
general historical interests are not noted, but may also play important roles in
battlefield preservation.

Appendix C. Civil War Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants
The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002 (PL 107-359) amended the American
Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 (16 USC 469k) to authorize a matching grant program
to assist States and local communities in acquiring significant Civil War battlefield lands
for permanent protection. Eligible battlefields are those listed in the 1993 Report on the
Nation’s Civil War Battlefields prepared by the Congressionally-chartered Civil War Sites
Advisory Commission (CWSAC). Eligible acquisition projects may be for fee interest in
land or for a protective interest such as a perpetual easement.
Since 1998, Congress has appropriated a total of $34.9 million for this Civil War
Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants (CWBLAG). These grants have assisted in the
permanent protection of 14,741 acres at 59 Civil War battlefields in 14 states. Of the 54
battlefields these funds have helped, 3 are in Kentucky.
