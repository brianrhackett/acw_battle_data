Introduction
The information in this report fulfills, in part, the purposes of the Civil War Battlefield
Preservation Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-359, 111 Stat. 3016). Those purposes are:
1) to act quickly and proactively to preserve and protect nationally significant Civil
War battlefields through conservation easements and fee-simple purchases of those
battlefields from willing sellers; and
2) to create partnerships among state and local governments, regional entities, and
the private sector to preserve, conserve, and enhance nationally significant Civil
War battlefields.
The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002 directs the Secretary of the Interior,
acting through the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP) of the National Park
Service, to update the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission (CWSAC) Report on the Nation’s
Civil War Battlefields. The CWSAC was established by Congress in 1991 and published its
report in 1993. Congress provided funding for this update in FY 2005 and FY 2007.
Congress asked that the updated report reflect the following:
•
•
•

Preservation activities carried out at the 384 battlefields identified by the CWSAC
during the period between 1993 and the update;
Changes in the condition of the battlefields during that period; and
Any other relevant developments relating to the battlefields during that period.

In accordance with the legislation, this report presents information about Civil War
battlefields in Florida for use by Congress, federal, state, and local government agencies,
landowners, and other interest groups. Other state reports will be issued as surveys and
analyses are completed.

Synopsis
There are six Civil War Sites Advisory Commission (CWSAC) battlefields in the State of
Florida – Fort Brooke, Natural Bridge, Olustee, Saint John’s Bluff, Santa Rosa
Island, and Tampa. Historically, these battlefields encompassed more than 25,500 acres.1
Today, approximately 14,600 acres, or 56 percent, retain sufficient significance and
integrity to make them worthy of preservation.2
In 1993, the CWSAC used a four-tiered system that combined historic significance, current
condition, and level of threat to determine priorities for preservation among the
battlefields. Table 1 indicates how the CWSAC prioritized Florida’s Civil War battlefields in
their study.

Currently, two of the battlefields identified as Priority III landscapes in 1993 retain a high
degree of integrity. While no battlefield remains completely unaltered since the Civil War,
Natural Bridge and Olustee have experienced relatively little change to their terrain and
aboveground battle features in nearly 150 years. (see Table 3).3
In 2009, the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP) survey found that Natural
Bridge retains 100 percent of its integrity. The State of Florida owns 62 acres of the
battlefield which it maintains as the Natural Bridge Battlefield State Historic Site. An
additional 4 acres is protected as part of the Northwest Florida Water Management
District’s Gerrell Conservation Easement. The remainder of the landscape, 2,234 acres or
97 percent of the battlefield is in private, unprotected ownership.
The USDA Forest Service and the State of Florida own 691 acres of land at the Olustee
battlefield which are maintained as the Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park. An
additional 306 acres at the USDA Forest Service’s Olustee Experimental Forest are managed
specifically for conservation purposes and are considered protected. The remainder of the
landscape that retains integrity, 4,530 acres or 81 percent of the battlefield, is either
privately owned or is owned by the Federal government for uses other than those
compatible with the goals of historic landscape preservation.

Santa Rosa Island, the third battlefield identified as a Priority III landscape in 1993, has
experienced moderate change to its landscape since the time of battle. The island has lost
land due to erosion; however, the portion of the island that remains retains integrity as a
battlefield landscape. Fort Pickens, the primary objective of the Confederate attack on the
island, still stands and is maintained as an historic resource. The fort and island are
managed by the National Park Service as part of Gulf Islands National Seashore.
While the CWSAC originally determined that Saint John’s Bluff did not retain sufficient
integrity to merit preservation, the ABPP’s resurvey of the site has shown that more than
59 percent of the battlefield retains integrity. More than 80 percent of that area is the
Saint John’s River. The land area that retains integrity is managed by the National Park
Service as part of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve and is considered
protected.
Tampa and Fort Brook have suffered the greatest degree of modern intrusion. In 1993,
the CWSAC determined that these battlefields were substantially fragmented. Both
battlefields are in an urban setting and have undergone considerable change since the
Civil War. There is no protected battlefield land at either of these sites and the ABPP did
not identify any additional portions of landscape that retain historic integrity. Today, only
commemorative and interpretive opportunities, rather than land preservation, are
appropriate actions at these two battlefields.
See the Individual Battlefield Profiles for detailed condition assessments and preservation
recommendations. The National Park Service will issue updated priorities after all CWSAC
battlefields nationwide have been surveyed and all state reports have been completed.

Method Statement
Congress instructed the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the American Battlefield
Protection Program (ABPP), to report on changes in the condition of the battlefields since
1993 and on “preservation activities” and “other relevant developments” carried out at
each battlefield since 1993. To fulfill those assignments, the ABPP 1) conducted a site
survey of each battlefield, and 2) prepared and sent out questionnaires to battlefield
managers and advocacy organizations (see Appendix D).
The 1993 significance rankings for each battlefield stand. Significance was assigned by the
Civil War Sites Advisory Commission and the ABPP sustains the CWSAC’s opinions as to the
relevant importance of each battle within the larger context of the war.

Research and Field Surveys
The ABPP conducted the field assessments of Florida battlefields in September 2009. The
surveys entailed additional historical research, on-the-ground documentation and
assessment of site conditions, identification of impending threats to each site, and site
mapping. Surveyors used a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to map historic
features of each battlefield and used a Geographic Information System (GIS) program to
draw site boundaries. The ABPP retains all final survey materials. Each battlefield survey
file includes a survey form (field notes, list of defining features, list of documentary
sources, and a photo log), photographs, spatial coordinates of significant features, and
boundaries described on USGS topographic maps. The surveys did not include
archeological investigations for reasons of time and expense.
Study Areas and Core Areas
With the exception of Olustee, the CWSAC established a Study Area and a Core Area for
each of Florida’s principal battlefields in 1993 (see Figure 3 for definitions). The CWSAC
boundaries have proven invaluable as guides to local land and resource preservation
efforts at Civil War battlefields. Since 1993 however, the National Park Service has refined
its battlefield survey methodology, which include research, working with site stewards,
identifying and documenting lines of approach and withdrawal used by opposing forces,
and applying the concepts of military terrain analysis to all battlefield landscapes. The
ABPP’s Battlefield Survey Manual explains the field methods employed during this study.4
The surveys also incorporate the concepts recommended in the National Register of
Historic Places’ Guidelines for Identifying, Evaluating, and Registering America’s Historic
Battlefields, which was published in 1992 after the CWSAC completed its original
assessments of the battlefields.5
Using its refined methodology, the ABPP was able to validate or adjust the CWSAC’s Study
Area and Core Area boundaries to reflect more accurately the full nature and original
resources of these battlefields (see Table 2). At many of Florida’s surveyed battlefields, the
refined methodology resulted in significant increases to the sizes of the Study Area and
Core Area. In particular, the original CWSAC surveys did not consistently include routes of
approach and withdrawal or secondary actions that influenced the course or outcome of
the battle. The revised boundaries take these movements and actions into account.6 It is

National Register Bulletin 40, Guidelines for Identifying, Evaluating, and Registering America’s Historic Battlefields
(http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/pdfs/NRB40.pdf), offers recommendations regarding “Selecting Defensible
Boundaries.” While this document indicates that “generally, boundaries should not be drawn to include the portion of the route
taken to the battlefield where there were no encounters,” the guidelines also state that “a basic principle is to include within the
boundary all of the locations where opposing forces, either before, during or after the battle, took actions based on their assumption
of being in the presence of the enemy.” The ABPP interprets this latter guidance to mean all military activities that influenced the
battle. See the individual battlefield profiles for information about military actions taken along the routes included. In accordance

important to note however, that the Study
Area and Core Area boundaries are simply
historical boundaries that describe where the
battle took place; neither indicates the current
integrity of the battlefield landscape, so
neither can be used on its own to identify
surviving portions of battlefield land that may
merit protection and preservation.
Potential National Register Boundaries
To address the question of what part of the
battlefield remains reasonably intact and
warrants preservation, this study introduced a
third boundary line that was not attempted by
the CWSAC: the Potential National Register
boundary (see Figure 3).
Looking at each Study Area, the surveyors
assigned PotNR boundaries where they judged
that the landscape retained enough integrity
to convey the significance of the historic
battle. In a few cases, the PotNR boundary
encompasses the entire Study Area. In most
cases, however, the PotNR boundary includes
less land than identified in the full Study Area.
Because many battlefields are entirely in
private ownership and physical access to large
portions of the battlefields is limited to public
right of ways, the ABPP reviewed publicly
available satellite images of the battlefield
Study Areas in order to confirm or supplement
surveyors’ field observations about land use
and landform integrity.7
In assigning PotNR boundaries, the ABPP
followed National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) guidelines when identifying and
mapping areas that retain integrity and
cohesion within the Study Areas.8 Because the
ABPP focuses only on areas of battle however,
the Program did not evaluate lands adjacent
to the Study Area that may contribute to a
broader historical and chronological definition
of “cultural landscape.” Lands outside of the

Figure 3: Boundary Definitions
The Study Area represents the historic
extent of the battle as it unfolded across the
landscape. The Study Area contains resources
known to relate to or contribute to the battle
event: where troops maneuvered and
deployed, immediately before, during, and
after combat, and where they fought during
combat. Historic accounts, terrain analysis,
and feature identification inform the
delineation of the Study Area boundary. The
Study Area indicates the extent to which
historic and archeological resources
associated with the battle (areas of combat,
command, communications, logistics, medical
services, etc.) may be found. Surveyors
delineated Study Area boundaries for every
battle site that was positively identified
through research and field survey, regardless
of its present integrity.
The Core Area represents the areas of
fighting on the battlefield. Positions that
delivered or received fire, and the intervening
space and terrain between them, fall within
the Core Area. Frequently described as
“hallowed ground,” land within the Core
Area is often the first to be targeted for
protection. There may be more than one
Core Area on a battlefield, but all lie within
the Study Area.
Unlike the Study and Core Areas, which are
based only upon the interpretation of historic
events, the Potential National Register
(PotNR) boundary represents ABPP’s
assessment of a Study Area’s current integrity
(the surviving landscape and features that
convey the site’s historic sense of place). The
PotNR boundary may include all or some of
the Study Area, and all or some of the Core
Area. Lands within PotNR boundaries should
be considered worthy of further attention,
although future evaluations may reveal more
or less integrity than indicated by the ABPP
surveys.

with the methodology of this study, if routes included in the Study Area retain integrity, they are included within the Potential
National Register boundary for the battlefield landscape.

The ABPP primarily used satellite images from the World Wide Web mapping services Bing, Google, and Yahoo. The date range
for the sattelite images was 2007-2010. The level of detail in the sattelite images available from each mapping service depended
upon the service’s coverage of a specified area; image resolutions were generally highly detailed in urban and suburban areas and
less detailed in rural areas.

For general guidance about integrity issues and National Register of Historic Places properties, see National Park Service, How to
Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the Interior, revised 1997). The survey
evaluations described above do not meet the more stringent integrity standards for National Historic Landmark designation. See
National Park Service, How to Prepare National Historic Landmark Nominations (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the Interior,
1999), 36-37.

Study Area associated with other historic events and cultural practices may need to be
evaluated in preparation for a formal nomination of the cultural landscape.
Most importantly, the PotNR boundary does not constitute a formal determination of
eligibility by the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places.9 The PotNR
boundary is designed to be used as a planning tool for government agencies and the
public. Like the Study and Core Area boundaries, the PotNR boundary places no restriction
on private property use.
The term integrity, as defined by the NRHP, is “the ability of a property to convey its
significance.”10 While assessments of integrity are traditionally based on seven specific
attributes – location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association –
battlefields are unique cultural resources and require special evaluation.“ Generally, the
most important aspects of integrity for battlefields are location, setting, feeling and
association,” and the most basic test for determining the integrity of any battlefield is to
assess “whether a participant in the battle would recognize the property as it exists
today.”11
Other conditions contribute to the degree of integrity a battlefield retains:
•

the quantity and quality of surviving battle-period resources (e.g.,
buildings, roads, fence lines, military structures, and archeological
features);

•

the quantity and quality of the spatial relationships between and among
those historic resources and the landscape that connects them;

•

the extent to which current battlefield land use is similar to battle-period
land use; and

•

the extent to which a battlefield’s physical features and overall character
visually communicate an authentic sense of the sweep and setting of the
battle.

The degree to which post-war development has altered and fragmented the historic
landscape or destroyed historic features and viewsheds is critical when assessing integrity.
Changes in traditional land use over time do not generally diminish a battlefield’s
integrity. For example, landscapes that were farmland during the Civil War do not need to
be in agricultural use today to be considered eligible for listing in the NRHP so long as the
land retains its historic rural character. Similarly, natural changes in vegetation – woods
growing out of historic farm fields, for example – do not necessarily lessen the landscape’s
integrity.
Some post-battle development is expected; slight or moderate change within the
battlefield may not substantially diminish a battlefield’s integrity. A limited degree of

study, but should be considered in future battlefield studies and formal nominations to the National Register.

residential, commercial, or industrial development is acceptable. These post-battle “noncontributing” elements are often included in the PotNR boundary in accordance with
NRHP guidelines.12
Significant changes in land use since the Civil War do diminish the integrity of the
battlefield landscape. Heavy residential, commercial, and industrial development; cellular
tower and wind turbine installation; and large highway construction are common
examples of such changes. Battlefield landscapes with these types of changes are
generally considered as having little or no integrity.
The PotNR boundaries therefore indicate which battlefields are likely eligible for future
listing in the NRHP and likely deserving of future preservation efforts.13 If a surveyor
determined that a battlefield was entirely compromised by land use incompatible with the
preservation of historic features (i.e., it has little or no integrity), the ABPP did not assign a
PotNR boundary.14
In cases where a battlefield is already listed in the NRHP, surveyors reassessed the existing
documentation based on current scholarship and resource integrity, and, when
appropriate, provided new information and proposed new boundaries as part of the
surveys. As a result, some PotNR boundaries will contain or share a boundary with lands
already listed in the NRHP. In other cases, PotNR boundaries will exclude listed lands that
have lost integrity (see Table 4.)15
The data from which all three boundaries are drawn do not necessarily reflect the full
research needed for a formal NRHP nomination. PotNR boundaries are based on an
assessment of aboveground historic features associated with the cultural and natural
landscape. The surveys did not include a professional archeological inventory or
assessment of subsurface features or indications. In some cases, future archeological
testing will help determine whether subsurface features remain, whether subsurface battle
features convey important information about a battle or historic property, and whether
that information may help to confirm, refine, or refute the boundaries previously
determined by historic studies and terrain analysis.
The ABPP survey information should be reassessed during future compliance processes
such as the Section 106 process required by the National Historic Preservation Act 16 and
Environmental Impact Statements/Environmental Assessments required by the National
Environmental Policy Act.17 Likewise, more detailed research and assessments should take
place when any battlefield is formally nominated to the NRHP or proposed for designation
12

The ABPP looks only at the battle-related elements of a cultural landscape. Post-battle elements, while not contributing to the
significance of the battlefield, may be eligible for separate listing in the National Register of Historic Places on their own merits.
13
Future nominations of battlefield land may take the form of districts (most common), or individual sites within a multiple property
context (appropriate for battlefields with far-flung resources). The ABPP’s survey boundaries do not imply any one approach; they
serve only as a starting point for discussions between the nominating agent and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
14
National Park Service, National Register Bulletin 40, Guidelines for Identifying, Evaluating, and Registering America’s Historic
Battlefields, 1992 , Revised 1999 (http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/pdfs/NRB40.pdf), offers recommendations
regarding "Selecting Defensible Boundaries." While this document indicates that "generally, boundaries should not be drawn to
include the portion of the route taken to the battlefield where there were no encounters," the Guidelines also state that "a basic
principle is to include within the boundary all of the locations where opposing forces, either before, during or after the battle, took
actions based on their assumption of being in the presence of the enemy." The ABPP interprets this latter guidance to mean all
military activities that influenced the battle. See the individual battlefield profiles for information about military actions taken along
the routes included. In accordance with the methodology of this study, if routes included in the Study Area retain integrity, they are
included within the Potential National Register boundary for the battlefield landscape.
15
The ABPP’s surveys and PotNR assessments do not constitute formal action on behalf of the office of the National Register of
Historic Places. PotNR assessments are intended for planning purposes only; they do not carry the authority to add, change, or
remove an official listing.

as a National Historic Landmark (NHL). New research and intensive-level surveys of these
sites will enlighten future preservation and compliance work. Agencies should continue to
consult local and state experts for up-to-date information about these battlefields.
The ABPP has identified approximately 13,800 acres associated with four battlefields in
Florida eligible for listing in the NRHP. Portions of all four of these battlefields are already
listed in the NRHP; however, the existing documentation does not express accurately the
size or current integrity of these four battlefields. The ABPP believes that the two sites
listed as battlefield landscapes should be reevaluated and the two sites listed for their
historic resources should be considered for listing as battlefield landscapes.

Questionnaires
While the ABPP maintains data about its own program activities at Civil War battlefields,
most preservation work occurs at the local level. Therefore, to answer Congress's directive
for information about battlefield preservation activities, the ABPP sought input from local
battlefield managers and advocacy organizations. The ABPP distributed questionnaires
designed to gather information about the types of preservation activities that have taken
place at the battlefields since 1993. The Questionnaire is reproduced in Appendix B.
In Florida, representatives of five organizations completed and returned questionnaires.
Their responses, combined with the survey findings, allowed the ABPP to create a profile
of conditions and activities at Florida’s Civil War battlefields.

Summary of Conditions of Florida’s Civil War Battlefields
Quantified Land Areas
Using Geographic Information Systems software, the ABPP calculated the amount of land
historically associated with the battle (Study Area), the amount of land where forces were
engaged (Core Area), and the amount of land that may retain enough integrity to be
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and that remains to be
protected (Potential National Register boundary).
As noted above and as Table 2 illustrates, the Study Areas and Core Areas of Florida’s
battlefields have been revised in many cases. In particular, the original CWSAC surveys did
not consistently include routes of approach and withdrawal or secondary actions that
influenced the course or outcome of the battle. The revised boundaries take these
movements and actions into account.18 In some instances, new or additional research has
sharpened historical understanding of battle events. Therefore, the ABPP determined that
additional lands belong appropriately in the Study and Core Areas because they lend
additional understanding to the battle story. The individual battlefield profiles at the end
of this report provide additional information about the extent of and reasons for any
revisions to the CWSAC Study Area and Core Area boundaries.

Condition Assessments
Using field survey data, the ABPP assessed the overall condition of each battlefield’s Study
Area. While no battlefield remains completely unaltered since the Civil War, four of
Florida’s battlefields have retained character defining features over the past 150 years.19
The landscape at Natural Bridge is in good condition with very little change since the
time of battle. The greatest threat to the landscape is development to the north and west
of the battlefield due to its proximity to Tallahassee and Woodville. The Wakulla
Correctional Institution also poses a potential threat to the Confederate approach route
from Newport (Old Plank Road.) If the State expands the facility to the east it could
impact the viewshed along the route. The Natural Bridge Historical Society, Inc., in

National Register Bulletin 40, Guidelines for Identifying, Evaluating, and Registering America’s Historic Battlefields

with the methodology of this study, if routes included in the Study Area retain integrity, they are included within the Potential
National Register boundary for the battlefield landscape.

cooperation with the State of Florida, is actively working to preserve the Natural Bridge
battlefield both within and beyond the boundaries of the Natural Bridge Battlefield
Historic State Park. Reevaluation of the NRHP documentation and nomination of the
entire battlefield landscape to the NRHP would be appropriate next steps in the
preservation of this battlefield.
Olustee also remains in good condition. The USDA Forest Service owns 51 percent of the
battlefield, 22 percent of which is protected as part of the Olustee Battlefield Historic State
Park. The remaining battlefield lands are owned by timber companies, private individuals,
Baker County, and the State of Florida. The primary long-term threat to the battlefield is
logging, which can alter terrain features and disturb or destroy archeological evidence of
the battle. Reevaluation of the NRHP documentation, nomination of the entire battlefield
landscape to the NRHP, and development of plans to minimize damage to battlefield
terrain and archeological resources during forestry operations would be appropriate
preservation actions at Olustee.
Saint John’s Bluff and Santa Rosa Island have been altered to varying degrees since
the Civil War. The Study Areas of both battlefields retain integrity; however, the majority
of those areas are water. The land portions of these two battlefields are protected by the
National Park Service. The primary long term threat to both battlefields is erosion due to
natural forces in Pensacola Bay and the Saint John’s River.
Tampa and Fort Brooke have lost integrity as historic landscapes. The post-Civil War
growth of the city of Tampa has destroyed both battlefields. Although commemorative
and public interpretation opportunities exist and are appropriate, there is no opportunity
for meaningful landscape preservation.

Registration
The nation’s official method for recognizing historic properties worthy of preservation is
listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Sites and structures listed in the
NRHP meet national standards for documentation, physical integrity, and demonstrable
significance to the history of our nation. Federal, state, and local agencies use information
from the NRHP as a planning tool to identify and make decisions about cultural resources.
Federal and state laws, most notably Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966, require agencies to account for the effects their projects (roads, wetland permits,
quarrying, cell towers, etc.) may have on listed and eligible historic properties, such as
battlefields. Listing allows project designers to quickly identify the battlefield and avoid or
minimize impacts to the landscape.

Properties listed in the NRHP may also be eligible for federal and state historic
preservation grant programs. Recognition as an NRHP listed battlefield can advance public
understanding of and appreciation for the battlefield, and may encourage advocacy for its
preservation.20
Florida currently has two Civil War battlefields listed in the NRHP as battlefield
landscapes—Natural Bridge and Olustee. While Natural Bridge has more than 2,300
acres within its PotNR, only 36 acres are listed in the NRHP. At Olustee, slightly more than
5 acres are listed in the NRHP, which accounts for less than one percent of the battlefield
landscape that retains integrity. The NRHP documentation for both battlefields should be
reevaluated and expanded to include the historic landscapes in there entirety.
Although Santa Rosa Island and Saint John’s Bluff are not listed in the NRHP as
battlefield landscapes, individual defining features associated with the battles are listed
seperately. Fully 92 percent of Santa Rosa Island’s and 59 percent of Saint John’s Bluff’s
Study Areas retain integrity and merit nomination to the NRHP as battlefield landscapes.
Because large portions of both Study Areas are water, future nominations will need to
recognize the roles of both Pensacola Bay and the St. John’s River as contributing features
to the battlefields.
At Tampa and Fort Brooks, the ABPP believes the Study Areas of these battlefields no
longer retain enough integrity to merit listing in the NRHP as battlefield landscapes.
Overall the ABPP has identified approximately 13,800 additional acres associated with
battlefield landscapes in Florida eligible for listing in the NRHP. The ABPP believes that all
four battlefields should be reevaluated. The existing documentation for Natural Bridge
and Olustee does not express accurately their size or current integrity. In addition, the
ABPP believes there is enough integrity at Santa Rosa Island and Saint John’s Bluff to
make each potentially eligible for individual listing as a battlefield landscape. (For a
comparison of the listed land and the ABPP’s recommended boundaries, see the maps in
the Individual Battlefield Profiles.)

There are three levels of federal recognition for historic properties: Congressional designations such as national park units,
National Historic Landmarks, and listings in the National Register of Historic Places. Congress creates national park units. The
Secretary of the Interior designates National Historic Landmarks (NHL) – nationally significant historic sites – for their exceptional
value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is
the nation’s official list of cultural sites significant at the national, state, or local level and worthy of preservation. Historic units of
the National Park System and NHLs are also listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Stewardship
For the purposes of this update, “protected land” means battlefield land that is in public
or private non-profit ownership, or is under permanent protective easement, and is
managed specifically for 1) the purposes of maintaining the historic character of the
landscape and for preventing future impairment or destruction of the landscape and
historic features, or for 2) a conservation purpose and use compatible with the goals of
historic landscape preservation.
The ABPP established this definition because, while public ownership of land often
provides some level of protection for historic resources, it does not necessarily foreclose
the potential for damage. Federal, state, and municipal ownership may prevent private
development, and public ownership may require compliance with state and federal
environmental laws, but the primary uses (military readiness, timber production,
recreation, mineral extraction, impoundment, etc.) of that public land may not be
compatible with the perpetual protection and appropriate management of a battlefield
landscape.
Of the more than 14,600 acres of Civil War battlefield lands that survive in Florida, only 25
percent are protected. The majority of the land is held by two Federal agencies. The
National Park Service owns and manages approximately 4,000 acres at Saint John’s Bluff
and Santa Rosa Island. At Olustee, the USDA Forest Service preserves 688 acres within
the boundaries of the Osceola National Forest as a battlefield landscape. Although owned
by the Federal government, the land is managed by the State of Florida as part of the
Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park. In addition, 306 acres at Olustee are protected
within the USDA Forest Service’s Olustee Experimental Forest.
Until recently, the State of Florida protected only 11 acres of historic battlefield land at
two battlefields – Natural Bridge and Olustee. In 2009 the State, working with the
Natural Bridge Historical Society, Inc. and the Civil War Preservation Trust, acquired 55
acres of land within the Core Area of the Natural Bridge battlefield. In addition, the
Northwest Florida Water Management District holds the Gerrell Conservation Easement, 4
acres of which are within the Natural Bridge Study Area. While not designated for its
historic value, this land has been set aside for conservation purposes and uses compatible
with the goals of historic landscape preservation. Today, Florida protects 70 acres of Civil
War battlefield land.
Florida has one of the largest state land acquisition programs in the United States, Florida
Forever. The program has protected more than 2.4 million acres since 1990.21 In 2009,
Florida Forever funding supported the purchase of 55 acres of battlefield land at Natural
Bridge (as noted above), which was added to the Natural Bridge Battlefield Historic State
Park. Currently, more than 1,500 acres of battlefield land at Natural Bridge and Olustee
are within the boundaries of four Florida Forever projects.22 While the land in these project
areas has been identified for future acquisition for environmental conservation, Florida
Forever’s conservation goals and land use policies are considered compatible with the
goals of historic landscape preservation.

21

In the early 1990’s the Florida state legislature enacted Preservation 2000, a ten-year program designed to acquire and conserve
lands for environmental, historical, and recreational purposes. The program was followed in 2000 by Florida Forever which
continues Preservation 2000’s acquisition and conservation goals.
22
The four projects are: Florida’s First Magnitude Springs, Raiford to Osceola Greenway, St. Joe Timberland, and Upper St. Mark’s
River Corridor.

Public Access and Interpretation
In its questionnaire (see Appendix D), the ABPP asked battlefield stewards about the types of
public access and interpretation available at the battlefields. The ABPP did not collect
information about the purpose or intent of the interpretation and access, such as whether
development of wayside exhibit was for purely educational reasons, to promote heritage
tourism, or to boost local economic development.
The ABPP asked respondents to indicate the type of interpretation available at or about
the battlefield. The categories included brochures, driving tours, living history
demonstrations, maintained historic features or areas, walking tours and trails, wayside
exhibits, websites, and other specialized programs. The results, summarized in the
Individual Battlefield Profiles, indicate that three of Florida’s six Civil War battlefields offer
public access and facilities specifically dedicated to the interpretation of the battlefield
landscape and one that offers some level of interpretation pertaining to the battle.

Advocacy
Nonprofit organizations play important roles in protecting historic battlefields. They step in
to preserve historic sites when public funding and management for historic preservation are
absent. When public funding is available, nonprofits serve as vital partners in public-private
preservation efforts, acting as conduits for public funds, raising critical private matching
funds, keeping history and preservation in the public eye, and working with landowners to
find ways to protect battlefield parcels.
Two of Florida’s six Civil War battlefields have active nonprofit advocates – Natural
Bridge and Olustee. The Natural Bridge Historical Society, Inc. (NBHS) promotes the
historical and cultural aspects of the battlefield and works to preserve lands associated
with the battle of Natural Bridge. In 2009 the society helped to acquire 55 acres of land
within the battlefield’s Core Area for inclusion in Natural Bridge Battlefield Historic State
Park. In addition, the NBHS has recently begun partnering with the John G. Riley
Center/Museum for African American History & Culture to promote local Civil War history.
At Olustee the Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park Citizens Support Organization
provides support to the state park and advocates for the battlefield in the local
community.
While other organizations with more general historical interests may also play important
roles in preserving South Florida’s battlefields, these two groups are the only known local
organizations in Florida that have been dedicated solely to the goals of battlefield
preservation, interpretation, and promotion of these resources.

Condition Statement

The landscape at Natural Bridge is in good condition with very
little change since the time of battle. The greatest threat to the
landscape is development to the north and west of the battlefield
due to its proximity to Tallahassee and Woodville. The Wakulla
Correctional Institution also poses a potential threat to the
Confederate approach route from Newport (Old Plank Road.) If
the State expands the facility to the east it could impact the
viewshed along the route. Reevaluation of the NRHP
documentation and nomination of the entire battlefield landscape
to the NRHP would be appropriate next steps in the preservation
of Natural Bridge.

the Confederate works defending Olustee Station, the point from
which the Confederate forces advanced. The new Core Area was
drawn to reflect the nature of the terrain. The fighting took place in a
pine barren bordered on all sides by marshes, swamps, ponds, and

the battlefield, 22 percent of which is protected as part of the
Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park. The remaining battlefield
lands are owned by timber companies, private individuals, Baker
County, and the State of Florida. The primary long-term threat to
the battlefield is logging, which can alter terrain features and
disturb or destroy archeological evidence of the battle.
Reevaluation of the NRHP documentation, nomination of the
entire battlefield landscape to the NRHP, and development of
plans to minimize damage to battlefield terrain and archeological
resources during forestry operations would be appropriate
preservation actions at Olustee.

primary long term threat to the land is erosion due to natural
forces in the Saint John’s River. Nomination of the entire
battlefield landscape to the NRHP would be the most appropriate
preservation action at Saint John’s Bluff. Because a large

weather and climate on Fort Pickens pose a threat to the masonry
fortification. Nomination of the entire battlefield landscape to

Appendix A. Civil War Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants
The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002 (PL 107-359) amended the American
Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 (16 USC 469k) to authorize a matching grant program to
assist States and local communities in acquiring significant Civil War battlefield lands for
permanent protection. Most recently, Congress showed its continued support for these grants
through its reauthorization of this program within the Omnibus Public Land Management Act
of 2009 (PL 111-11).
Eligible battlefields are those listed in the 1993 Report on the Nation’s Civil War Battlefields
prepared by the Congressionally-chartered Civil War Sites Advisory Commission (CWSAC).
Eligible acquisition projects may be for fee interest in land or for a protective interest such as a
perpetual easement.
Since 1998, Congress has appropriated a total of $38.9 million for this Civil War Battlefield
Land Acquisition Grants (CWBLAG) Program. These grants have assisted in the permanent
protection of more than 16,600 acres at 67 Civil War battlefields in 14 states. To date, no
Florida battlefields have received funding from this source. Given the success of battlefield
land and easement acquisition in other states, CWBLAG funding can help protect historic
lands at Natural Bridge and Olustee battlefields in the future. While other battlefields
listed in this update are eligible for CWBLAG funding, applications to protect land that
retains integrity (within PotNR boundaries) will be the most competitive.

Appendix B. American Battlefield Protection Program Planning Grants
Since 1992, the ABPP has offered annual planning grants to nonprofit organizations,
academic institutions, and local, regional, state, and tribal governments to help protect
battlefields located on American soil. The ABPP encourages applicants to work with
partner organizations and government agencies in order to integrate their efforts into a
comprehensive landscape protection strategy. To date, Florida’s Civil War battlefields have
not received any American Battlefield Protection Program Planning Grants.
