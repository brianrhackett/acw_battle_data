Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. The portions of the battlefield outside of
the national battlefield are threatened severely. The pace of
growth around Murfreesboro is among the fastest in Tennessee.
Efforts to protect additional land associated with the battle need
to occur immediately.

destroyed more than 100 acres of the battlefield’s Core Area.

Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance. Recent,
accelerating residential development in the area, however,
threatens to eat away at the battlefield. Coordinated efforts
among local, state, federal, and private stakeholders are
needed to begin to protect substantial portions of Vaught’s Hill’s
historic landscape.
