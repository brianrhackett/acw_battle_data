Condition Statement

Despite large mixed-use developments on portions of the
battlefield, many of the most significant landscapes and views
within the battlefield remain in agricultural or open space uses.
However, the rapid pace of land development in Prince William
County signifies the need for immediate protection of the 3,000
intact acres not owned by the County.
