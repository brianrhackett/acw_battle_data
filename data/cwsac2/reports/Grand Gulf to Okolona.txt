Study Area

9,349.60 acres (Claiborne County, 7,779.70; and Tensas Parish, LA,
1,569.83)
The Study Area was modified to reflect the historic boundaries of the
Mississippi River, which was used by Federal forces to approach Grand
Gulf, and to include the landing site of the Federal XIII Corps at Hard
Times Plantation. The Core Area was adjusted to conform to the
historic boundaries of the Mississippi River, and was extended to
include the maximum range of the guns involved in the bombardment
of Grand Gulf’s two forts – Fort Cobun in the north and Fort Ward in
the south – by Federal Naval forces from the water.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. During the 1863 battle, the town of Grand Gulf
was positioned beside the Mississippi River at the point of a sharp
westward turn in the waterway’s course. Today, the riverbank has
shifted west, away from Grand Gulf. This shift, along with
construction of a modern levee, makes interpreting the battlefield
problematic. The US landing site at Hard Times Plantation and the
historic route to Disharoon Plantation/Landing are difficult to
pinpoint. Residential development along the approach route
undermines the battlefield’s integrity. In the town of Grand Gulf,
few historic features remain intact. What remains of the
battlefield landscape has been protected within the boundaries of
the Grand Gulf Military Park. The heights on which the
Confederates built fortifications still exist and dominate the
landscape as they did during the battle. Both Fort Wade and Fort
Cobun are intact, including most of their supporting earthworks.
Protection of intact battlefield land surrounding the existing state
park offers the greatest opportunity for preservation at Grand
Gulf.

Results

Study Area

3,261.17 acres
The CWSAC did not establish Study and Core Areas for Iuka in 1993.
ABPP’s new Study Area boundaries include Federal approach routes
and associated locations of skirmishing from the southwest along
Jacinto Road and from the northwest along Burnsville Road, as well as
the Confederate route of withdrawal and associated locations of
skirmishing along Fulton Road to the southeast. The town of Iuka,
which was occupied by Confederate forces prior to and during the
battle, is included within the Study Area. Several small roads used by
Confederate forces to approach/withdraw from the town/battlefield
are included, as well as locations north of town where Confederate
forces camped and formed in line of battle while they prepared to
engage Federal forces. A small Core Area in the south represents
combat around the Moore House. The larger Core Area in the north
represents the location of the battle’s most intense fighting.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The City of Iuka has grown considerably since
the time of the battle. U.S. Highway 72 and State Route 25 have
fragmented the battlefield’s largest Core Area into four segments.
These highways have also destroyed much of the historic road
network, including the crossroad epicenter where the battle’s
most intense fighting took place. While commercial development
in this area continues to pose a significant threat to what remains
of the Iuka battlefield, portions of the Federal advance along the
Jacinto Road still retain integrity. Although the automobile
transportation network has severely damaged this landscape, the
railroad, which was present at the time of the battle and retains
its historic route, is a character defining feature of this battlefield.
The ridgeline upon which Federal forces organized their battle
line remains intact, and several creek beds in the Study Area are
unchanged. Preservation efforts must be swift. Further
development will fragment Iuka so severely that it will be
unidentifiable as a battlefield landscape.

Revisions to the Study Area include the addition of the Federal
approach routes (Sherman’s and McPherson’s Corps) marching from
Clinton and Mississippi Springs on the morning of battle. The
Confederate retreat route along the Old Canton Road was also added.
Because there was little to no fighting within the city itself, the Core
Area was reduced to more accurately represent the specific locations
of fighting to the northwest and southwest of Jackson.

Condition Statement

The landscape has been altered beyond recognition.
Development within Jackson has destroyed most of the
earthworks that once surrounded the city. Jackson is almost
entirely surrounded by highways (Interstate 55, Interstate 20, and
Interstate 220). These large roads cut through the Study Area in
the east, west, and south. While the historic road network of
Jackson’s downtown is still apparent, the highways have damaged
the historic approach routes travelled by US forces as they entered
the city. Beyond the highways, these routes retain some integrity,
with most roads following their historic trace. Waterways such as
the Pearl River and Lynch Creek frame Jackson, just as they did at
the time of the battle. A small park in the battlefield’s southern
Core Area and a tiny portion of the University of Mississippi
Medical Center contain the only above-ground remnants of
Jackson’s earthwork system. Special care should be given to
preserve these important historic features.

Forces Engaged

Department of the Tennessee [US]; Department of Alabama,

Results

Union victory

Study Area

3,087.57 acres
The Study Area was reduced around Meridian to include only areas
within the city’s 1864 boundaries and locations associated with the
Federal encampment north of the city. The Federal approach route
from the northwest was added to the Study Area, while a route on
the east side of the Study Area was removed (it was not associated
with the battle dates of February 13-15, 1864). Although Sherman
expected to engage Confederate forces during his approach to the
city and within Meridian itself, no real fighting occurred. Confederate
troops departed from Meridian before Sherman’s troops arrived.
Federal forces occupied the city without substantial engagement with
Confederate troops. Because no fighting occurred, the Core Area
established by the CWSAC in 1993 was removed.

Condition Statement

Landscape and terrain features have been altered beyond
recognition. Unchecked growth in the City of Meridian has
obliterated its historic boundaries and road networks. Given the
dearth of intact features dating to the time of battle, there is no
potential for additional threat or historic resource protection.

Confederate victory

Study Area

38,415.04 acres
The ABPP extended the Study Area of this cavalry battle to include the
Federal running retreat route through Okolona, and heavy
skirmishing in areas northwest of the city and between Okolona and
West Point. The ABPP repositioned the Study Area along Pontotoc
Road in the northwest, and widened the boundary around Okolona to
include maneuvers made by Confederate and Federal troops in
preparation for the Confederate attack on Federal forces west of
town.
The ABPP added a new Core Area at the end of the US withdrawal
route to the northwest to represent the day’s last engagement, while
the existing Core Area in the north was enlarged to include the full
extent of fighting around Ivey’s Hill. The Core Area around Okolona
was redrawn to more accurately represent documented locations of
battle. Two Core Areas were added south of Okolona along the US
route of retreat. While heavy skirmishing occurred all along the
retreat route, these two new Core Areas represent locations where
opposing forces formed in line of battle and fought. An additional
Core Area was added west of West Point around Ellis Bridge to
represent the opening fight that began the Federal retreat towards
Okolona.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Much of Okolona’s historic road network has
been destroyed. The same is true for the town of West Point at
the southern end of the Study Area. Land protected within the
boundaries of the Tombigbee National Forest and the Natchez
Trace Parkway retains integrity. The rough terrain of the wooded
landscape is unchanged. State Highway 41 follows most of the old
Okolona Road trace, while US Alternate 45 closely aligns with
portions of the historic trace and runs parallel to the historic
railroad cut of the modern Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. The
landscape surrounding these transportation routes retains much
of its integrity. The heights near Prairie Mount and the Little Owl
Creek, along with Ivey’s Hill, are still identifiable topographic
features. While development along State Highway 41 and US
Alternate 45 is limited, the potential for sprawling growth
between the cities of Okolona and West Point represents the
greatest threat to this battlefield.
