combine the two engagements under one Study Area. The new
Study Area includes all actions and maneuvers associated with the
two engagements, and adds Confederate approach routes and a
new Core Area in the James River from which Federal gunboats
fired against the Confederate troops.

Condition Statement

Although land use is little changed since the period of
significance, modern development is beginning to fracture the
historic landscape. Increasing development in this part of
Henrico County suggests the need for immediate
preservation measures to stay further fragmentation of this
nationally significant battlefield.
