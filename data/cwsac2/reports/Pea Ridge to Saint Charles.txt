Pea Ridge Campaign

Battle Date(s)

March 6-8, 1862

Principal Commanders

Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis [US]; Major General Earl Van
Dorn [CS]

Forces Engaged

Army of the Southwest [US]; Army of the West [CS]

Results

Union victory

Study Area

9,834.22 acres
The Study Area was revised to more precisely reflect the nature and
constraints of the battlefield terrain. The Confederate approach
route from Camp Stevens was changed slightly to accommodate the
Bentonville Detour's path as documented by the Arkansas Historic
Preservation Program.
The ABPP, in consultation with the staff of Pea Ridge National
Military Park, made extensive changes to the Core Area. The single
Core Area mapped in 1993 by the CWSAC was divided in two, one
to represent the fighting at Elkhorn Tavern and the other to
represent the fighting at Lee Town.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Pea Ridge has the most protected land of any
Civil War battlefield in Arkansas. The 4,300 acres protected by the
National Park Service include many of the battlefield’s characterdefining features and half of the historic landscape. Private
holdings within the Study Area, particularly along US Route 62,
however, have been converted to residential and institutional uses.
Additional preservation efforts are needed to stem the destruction
of the historic landscape beyond the National Park Service
boundaries.

Study Area

7,633.37 acres
The ABPP revised the Study Area to better represent the battlefield
terrain and to illustrate the routes taken by the Confederate cavalry
(from where the various brigades broke off on their individual
attack routes). The Study Area was also revised to include areas
where looting, burning, and skirmishing occurred throughout the
city of Pine Bluff. The Core Area was reduced to the primary area of
action around Pine Bluff Court House and the surrounding city
blocks.

Study Area

11,628.13 acres
The 1993 Study Area boundary was a generic polygon that did not
accurately reflect the size and character of the battlefield landscape.
The ABPP significantly reduced the Study Area to more accurately
reflect troop movements, areas of fighting, and historic road
alignments. The Study Area was revised to include the location of
camps from which the Confederates marched north to intercept the
Federal wagon train; the route to Poison Spring; and the location
where Federal reinforcements met Williams’ troops near White Oak
Creek and began moving east. The eastern arm of the Study Area
represents the route taken by the portion of Williams’ force that
was able to retreat in order toward Union-occupied Camden.
The Core Area was reduced slightly to better reflect actual troop
movements and areas of fighting.

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Like other battlefields associated with the
Camden Expedition of 1864, Poison Spring offers a tremendous
opportunity for preservation and interpretation of the entire
historic landscape.
More than 1,400 acres of the battlefield lie within the Poison
Spring State Forest and are intensely managed for timber
production. Clear-cutting operations have and continue to
damage historic terrain and disturb archeological features
associated with the battle. The Arkansas Forestry Commission
(AFC) can avoid further damage to the battlefield by conducting
archeological and cultural landscape surveys of its holdings,
including appropriate treatment recommendations for battlefield
features in its forest management plan The AFC can also ensure
that forestry work in historically sensitive areas is carried out
according to those recommendations.
Preservation efforts should also focus on either amending the
current National Historic Landmark to include other lands within
the Study Area that retain integrity, or creating a separate listing
in the National Register of Historic Places for the battlefield
landscape.

Results

Union victory

Study Area

17,318.69 acres
The 1993 Study Area was a generic polygon that, while
encompassing the battle, did not accurately reflect the battlefield or
its topography. The ABPP revised the Study Area to reflect more
accurately troop movements, lines of battle, locations of
Confederate earthworks, approach and withdrawal routes, and the
landscape of the Prairie D'Ane. Routes added include Steele's
approach from the north from his encampment on the Cornelius
Farm; Price's approach from the west from Washington (he also
withdrew along this route); Steele's withdrawal to the east toward
Camden; and Brigadier General John Marmaduke's withdrawal
route to the south towards Prairie De Rohan. All routes saw
skirmishing among various elements of both forces.
The larger Core Area was shifted to the west along the historic road
alignment. It was also widened to encompass lines of battle over
several days as well as the Confederate earthworks near present day
Midway. The smaller Core Area represents “The Battle of Moscow,"
a rearguard engagement around and in the town of Moscow.

Condition Statement

While portions of the battlefield have been altered by road
construction and growth around the town of Prescott, most of the
historic landscape retains good integrity. Prairie D’Ane, like Bayou
Meto, will continue to suffer from development pressures if
preservation of the landscape does not occur in the near future.
Prairie D’Ane should be viewed as the highest priority for
protection among the Camden Expedition battlefields given its
current good condition and the continuing threat of development.

The Study Area was expanded to include the Confederate approach
route from Morrow and the Federal advances from Cane Hill and
Fayetteville. The Study Area was also revised to conform to the
high ground around Crawford's Prairie.
The Core Area was reduced to firing ranges of the artillery
employed during the battle. The ABPP added a new Core Area at
Walnut Grove to represent the cavalry fight that preceded the
general action.

Condition Statement

Much of the historic landscape has been altered and fragmented
by development associated with the growth of the City of Prairie
Grove, however, some essential features remain. Thanks to the
State of Arkansas and local preservation advocates, 34 percent of
the Core Area is protected in the Prairie Grove Battlefield State
Park. Ongoing protection efforts are needed, however, to keep
future growth from destroying historic terrain around the park.
Local, state, and national preservation partners should consider
immediate preservation of lands to the north and east of the
existing park boundary.

Study Area

1,830.99 acres
Southeast of the town of Saint Charles, the Study Area was
narrowed to the historic width of the White River. The Study Area
was widened approximately 2.5 miles below the location of the
Confederate batteries in Saint Charles; this is approximately where
the 46th Indiana disembarked and proceeded on foot toward the
town.
The Core Area was revised to illustrate the firing ranges of the
Union gunboats, which fired onto the river shore two miles below
the Confederate batteries. The gunboats continued to fire onto the
shore until they reached and attacked the batteries.

Condition Statement

While a portion of the landscape around the town of Saint Charles
has been compromised, the battlefield retains a high degree of
integrity overall. More than 82 percent of the battlefield is
protected from development by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
and the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission. An additional 10
percent of the battlefield that retains integrity, however, needs
further protection. Because the terrain has such a high degree of
integrity, preservation advocates should focus efforts on both
protecting the remaing 10 percent of the battlefield and listing it
in the National Register of Historic Places as a battlefield
landscape.
