Study Area

14,266.22 acres
The ABPP expanded the Study Area to include the Federal approach
route from New Creek and the location of a flank attack against the
Confederate position near Moorefield. The Federal advance on
Moorefield closely follows modern Highway 220 and Route 28. The
Federal flanking maneuver, which began in New Creek, followed
Highway 50 to County Route 10, and then progressed down a series
of smaller country roads before finally linking up with Route 55 to
merge onto Cunningham Lane. In addition, the Study Area was also
revised to include two separate Confederate retreat routes along
Highway 220 and Route 55. The Core Area was also expanded to
include terrain covered in the moving cavalry fight.

Condition Statement

Much of the battlefield is altered and fragmented, although some
essential features remain. The fighting, save the artillery employed
from the hills of the present day campus of Alderson Broaddus
College, occurred mainly in the city. What remains of the Core Area
are the heights northeast of the city and the heights on the west
bank of the Tygart River. The lands along the Federals’ eastern
approach from Grafton also retain integrity. The locations of the
Confederate encampments are now sites of commercial or
residential development. Development associated with the growth
of Philippi and the college will continue to fracture the historic
landscape.
Some land preservation is still possible at Philippi, but protection
efforts must be made immediately to save worthwhile portions of
the field.
