Condition Statement

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Tom’s Brook will continue to benefit from
public-private protection efforts. The planned widening of
Interstate 81, if not designed by preservation advocates and
transportation planners to avoid or minimize impacts, will
destroy areas of the battlefield landscape.

Condition Statement

Development is steadily eating away the historic landscape.
The main Core Area for Totopotomoy Creek was fought over
again during the battle of Cold Harbor (VA062). Like the Cold
Harbor battlefield, Totopotomoy Creek offers substantial
opportunities for land preservation beyond the publicly and
privately protected holdings.
