The Study Area was revised to include the Federal advance from
Hamburg directly against Fort DeRussy—the opening land action of
the Red River Campaign—and the historic curve of the Red River.
The Core Area was adjusted to represent the range of opposing
artillery during the battle and the field of fire from Federal naval
vessels during their attack against the fort.

Condition Statement

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The principal resources associated with this
battlefield are the Mississippi River, Fort Jackson, and Fort St.
Philip. The Mississippi River has been significantly engineered to
remain on its present course and while the battlefield retains a
good deal of integrity, the condition of the forts is poor.
In 2005, Fort Jackson was damaged by
hurricanes Katrina and Rita and was under
water for approximately one month. The fort
walls were destabilized when hurricane winds
blew over the mature trees that had been
allowed to grow atop the fort walls. The
resulting water infiltration is contributing to
further decay of the historic masonry. The
structurally unsound fort has been closed to the
public since 2005. In addition, an existing
stadium adjacent to Fort Jackson and the
Mississippi River levee detracts from the
battlefield’s historic setting.
Figure 6. Water continues to penetrate and erode Fort
Jackson. Photograph by Joseph E. Brent, 2008.

Fort St. Phillip (which was not surveyed by the ABPP due to its
isolated location) consists of overgrown ruins and is more
archeological site than standing structure. The fort is only
accessible by boat or helicopter, which helps protect it from
looters, but its remote location also complicates efforts to
mitigate damage to the site.
Both forts have been designated as National Historic Landmarks.
They both require considerable effort and funding to reverse the
ravages brought upon them by natural forces. Without
immediate intervention, both will continue to deteriorate.

Study Area

3,140.48 acres
The Study Area was revised to include the location of the Federal
camp north of Napoleonville (from which Weitzel marched to
intercept the oncoming Confederates) and the Confederate retreat
route south to the point where Federal skirmishers broke off
pursuit. The Core Area was expanded slightly to include the
location of the Federal pontoon bridge over Bayou Lafourche;
Union soldiers crossing at this point came under heavy fire from
Confederate infantry and artillery.

The ABPP significantly revised the CWSAC’s 1993 battlefield
boundaries. The location of Goodrich’s Landing was found to be
further south than originally thought in 1993 and the Study Area
was revised accordingly. The Study Area was also expanded to
include the Mississippi Marine Brigade’s line of march from Young's
Point to intercept Parson’s retreating Confederates. An additional
Core Area at Bayou Tensas was drawn to represent the Confederate
rearguard action on June 30.

Condition Statement

In 1876, the Mississippi River shifted to the east, changing the
battlefield landscape along the river channel as it existed at the
time of battle. The open, agricultural landscape is still present
within much of the Study Area. The Indian mounds on which
Federal forces constructed their fortifications survive, but a modern
farm detracts from the historic setting around the mounds. The
massive Mississippi River levee also affects the viewshed of the
battlefield. Archeological looting is the greatest threat to this
isolated battlefield. Apart from this movement of the river, the
battlefield retains good integrity and offers opportunities for full
protection of the remaining landscape.

growing and ultimately may destroy the historic landscape if land

Thibodaux, located approximately halfway between New Orleans
and Baton Rouge, is growing quickly. There has been a great deal
of residential development near the battlefield, especially to the
west along State Route 1. On the east side of Bayou Lafourche,
State Route 308 is heavily traveled and could be widened in the
near future, a project that would pose a major threat to the
battlefield. Undisturbed land in the eastern Core Area and along
the railroad should be the target of preservation activities at this
battlefield.
