small size of the battle, coupled with only modest development
pressure, makes feasible complete preservation of surviving
lands within the next decade.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented,
leaving some essential features. Rapid development of this area
continues. The planned widening of Interstate 81, if not designed
by preservation advocates and transportation planners to avoid or
minimize impacts, will destroy portions of the battlefield landscape.
New opportunities for land preservation will likely disappear within
the next five years.
