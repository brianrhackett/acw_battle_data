The Study Area was revised to include the Federal route of advance
from the south. MG Augur had headed north intending to secure a
landing on the Mississippi River, but was intercepted by the
Confederates at Plains Store. The advance/withdrawl route from
Port Hudson of the Confederate reinforcements under Col. Miles
was extended to the west. The Core Area was revised to more
accurately reflect the primary area of fighting.

The revised Study Area includes the Confederate route of advance from
the Mansfield battlefield, where the two armies had fought the previous
day, to the vicinity of the Federal position at Pleasant Hill. The Study
Area also includes the route of the Federal retreat towards Grand Ecore
as the battle ended. The Core Area was widened to the north and south
to include land over which the Confederates attempted flanking
manouevres against the Federal left.

Condition Statement

Land use has changed little around Pleasant Hill since the Civil War.
While the historic town of Pleasant Hill is no longer extant and
power lines and oil wells cross and dot the landscape, the open
ground and wood lines are in keeping with the historic character
of the battlefield. Residential and commercial development

Study Area

11,949.48 acres
The ABPP revised significantly the 1993 Study Area boundary. The
boundary now reflects the historic curve of the Mississippi River at
Port Hudson and includes the overland advance of the XIX Corps
from Bayou Sara to Plains Store, where Major General Banks
rendezvoused with Major General Christopher C. Augur’s division
before investing the town of Port Hudson. The Core Area was
adjusted to include Federal siege lines to the north, east, and south
of the Confederate fortifications around Port Hudson, the Federal
mortar flotilla south of Port Hudson in the Mississippi River, the
Federal naval and army batteries built across the river from Port
Hudson, and the naval field of fire from Farragut's flotilla against
the Confederate positions northwest of Port Hudson.

Condition Statement

Portions of the Port Hudson battlefield have been altered, but
most essential features remain. The battlefield has suffered both
natural and manmade changes since the Civil War. The Mississippi
River has shifted considerably since the war, leaving land and
marsh where, in 1863, Union gunboats fired on Confederate
positions. The portions of the Study Area affected by the river’s
movements are not included in the ABPP’s Potential National
Register boundary (although future archeological investigations
may confirm the presence of battle material in these areas).
The Georgia Pacific paper mill on the southern end of the
battlefield has destroyed the historic landscape in that location.
Existing and increasing residential construction also diminishes the
battlefield’s integrity. Fortunately, the northern portion of the
battlefield is protected within the Port Hudson Battlefield State
Historic Site.
Within commuting distance of Baton Rouge, the residential
development along US Route 61 and its feeder routes will continue
to grow. Modest subdivisions are located within the Study Area.
Further industrial and residential development will eat away at the
unprotected portions of the battlefield. Immediate federal, state,
and local efforts are needed to preserve this nationally significant
battlefield.

Condition Statement

Land use has changed little since the Civil War. Stirling’s Plantation
battlefield—a patchwork of lowlands, bayou, and tree lines—has a
high degree of integrity. Residential development and oil
exploration represent potential, but not immediate, threats.
Today, Stirling’s Plantation presents one of best opportunities for
comprehensive battlefield landscape protection in Louisiana.

of retreat to Opelousas was also added. The Core Area was revised to
more accurately represent the primary area of fighting.

Condition Statement

The landscape and terrain of the battlefield have been altered
beyond recognition since the time of battle. Vermillion Bayou
battlefield has lost its integrity; it has been overtaken by the
growth of the City of Lafayette. Commemoration and public

Results

Strategic Union victory

Study Area

5,067.51 acres
The ABPP revised the Study Area, extending the boundary west to
include the Federal retreat from Moreauville and reducing the
boundary around the Yellow Bayou crossing, based on the location
of swampy ground that restricted movement at that point. After a
close review of The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the
Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, the ABPP
relocated the Core Area west of the Yellow Bayou, to include the
area where the fighting actually took place.

Condition Statement

Portions of the Yellow Bayou battlefield have been altered, but
most essential features remain. Although growth around
Simmesport has destroyed the eastern portion of the Study Area, the
remaining battlefield is open farmland and retains good integrity as
a battlefield landscape. Development pressure is not high in this
area. Yellow Bayou battlefield offers opportunities for full
protection of the remaining landscape within the next decade.
