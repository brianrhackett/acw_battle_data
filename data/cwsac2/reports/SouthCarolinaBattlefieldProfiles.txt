Study Area

5,164.74 acres
The ABPP revised the 1993 Study Area to include the Confederate
earthworks at Cummings Point, Battery Wagner, and Forts Moultrie,
Beauregard, and Johnson. The ABPP also expanded the northern edge of
the Study Area to incorporate the line of Confederate obstructions that
spanned the inner harbor and extended the Study Area south to include
the main shipping channel of Charleston Harbor, which US naval forces
used as their route of approach from the south.
ABPP adjustments to the Core Area better reflect the firing ranges of the
Confederate batteries engaged during the battle and the US naval forces
firing from the water. Because an attempted torpedo attack on the USS
New Ironsides never materialized, the 1993 Core Area representing that
location was removed.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The open waterways of Charleston Harbor
remain much as they were at the time of battle. With the
shorelines of Charleston to the west and islands to the north and
south, any on-looker approaching from the water (as US naval
forces did) can still appreciate Charleston Harbor as a defensible
position. The focal point of the battle – the area between Fort
Sumter and Fort Moultrie – retains much of its integrity.
During the course of the war, three quarters of Fort Sumter was
destroyed. Subsequently, the fort was partially rebuilt. Similarly,
post-war construction at Fort Moultrie breaks up the Civil War era
profile of that extant fortification. Fort Johnson and the northern
edge of Cummings Point on Morris Island retain integrity. The
construction of a large research facility around Fort Johnson,
however, has impacted most of the landscape at that site, and
erosion has washed away the batteries on Cummings Point.
Erosion is a natural process, but jetties, built to modify the natural
flow of currents and help divert silt and fill from the shipping
channels, exacerbate the effects of that process. Because of this,
they pose a significant threat to the battlefield resources of
Charleston Harbor. Since the time of fighting, this erosion has
shifted the location of Morris Island to the south and west. Today,
most of the historic landscape has eroded into the sea. Similarly,
dredging operations in Charleston Harbor and the shipping
channels have dumped thousands of tons of dredge fill into the
wetlands west of the barrier islands, creating entirely new islands
and peninsulas, or destroying sand bars that were present during
the battle.
Aggressive development in Charleston, Mount Pleasant, and
Sullivan’s Island has damaged the historic integrity of shoreline
sites, such as the Confederate fortifications of Fort Beauregard
and the Marshall Battery. Although development pressure has
recently slowed, Charleston and its surrounding communities
continue to grow. As more housing and associated infrastructure
development takes place at the water’s edge, threats to the
integrity of the historic landscape and harbor viewshed will
increase.
While a large portion of the Study Area for Charleston Harbor I,
retains integrity, much of that area is water. Any future
preservation will need to recognize the harbor’s role as a
contributing feature of the six battles of Charleston Harbor.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Fort Sumter retains a dominant position at the
center of Charleston Harbor and, from this crucial location, other
significant battlefield features – Charleston, Cummings Point, Fort
Moultrie, Fort Johnson, and Castle Pinckney – can be identified in
the surrounding landscape.
Fort Sumter is a substantially shorter structure today than it was at
the time of battle. Three quarters of the fort was destroyed
during the course of the war, but the fort was partially rebuilt at
the conflict’s conclusion. Post-war reconstruction at Fort Moultrie
breaks up the Civil War era profile of that fortification as well.
Fort Johnson and the northern edge of Cummings Point on Morris

around Fort Johnson has compromised most of the landscape at
that site and erosion has washed away the batteries on Cummings
Point. In addition, aggressive development in Charleston, Mount
Pleasant, and on Sullivan’s Island has damaged much of the
battlefield’s historic viewshed.
Fort Sumter, which is protected by the National Park Service, is not
threatened by development pressure. The structure is a masonry
fortification, however, which requires expensive, labor-intensive
care. Efforts to deepen the harbor channel have encouraged an
increase in heavy shipping, which throws larger, more violent
wakes against the fort’s masonry walls. Jetties built to protect
Fort Sumter from such wakes have been pushed against the
fortification and are now grinding and damaging the brick walls.
Action should be taken to mitigate this threat to the fabric of the
historic structure.
While a large portion of the Study Area for Fort Sumter I, retains

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. Since the time of battle, erosion has
shifted the location of Morris Island to the south and west. Today,
most of the historic landscape has washed into the sea, including
Fort Wagner and Battery Gregg. Although erosion is a natural
process, jetties, built to modify the natural flow of currents and
help divert silt and fill from the shipping channels, have
exacerbated the effect. While the historic landscape of Morris
Island is almost completely eroded away, what remains is the same
sort of sand barrier island that existed in 1863. Visitors can still
experience a sense of what it would have felt like to fight on the
island, even if the land itself does not retain much integrity.
Dredging operations in Charleston Harbor and the shipping
channels have also altered the landscape drastically. In several
locations, these efforts have created entirely new islands or
peninsulas. The dredging operations have destroyed many of the
sand bars that were present at the time of battle.
Aggressive development in Charleston, Mount Pleasant, James
Island, Folly Island, and Sullivan’s Island has damaged the historic
integrity of shoreline sites including the Confederate fortifications
of Fort Beauregard and the Marshall Battery. Much of the
landscape surrounding Fort Johnson has been destroyed by the
construction of a research facility. As more housing and
associated infrastructure development takes place at the water’s
edge, threats to the historic integrity of the landscape and harbor
viewshed will increase. The Confederate earthworks on James
Island are held almost exclusively in private ownership and,
although their locations are documented, there is no protection in
place to preserve the resources.
Despite these challenges, Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie still stand
guard in Charleston Harbor, the Light House Inlet and Folly Island
landscapes have changed little, and many of the wetlands south of
Morris Island retain integrity.
While a large portion of the Study Area for Fort Wagner I,
retains integrity, much of that area is water. Any future
preservation will need to recognize the harbor’s role as a
contributing feature of the six battles of Charleston Harbor.
Battlefield advocates should consider focusing efforts on a larger
thematic approach to preservation for Charleston Harbor’s

The Core Area was revised to represent the firing patterns of Fort Sumter
and the Confederate batteries on James Island (batteries Ryan, Tatom,
Haskell, Cheves, and Simkins) in response to Federal siege operations on
Morris Island. Additional Core Area modifications illustrate the fields of

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. Since the time of battle, erosion has
shifted the location of Morris Island to the south and west.
Although erosion is a natural process, jetties, built to modify the
natural flow of currents and help divert silt and fill from the
shipping channels, have exacerbated the effect. While the historic
landscape of Morris Island is almost completely eroded away
(including Fort Wagner and Battery Gregg), what remains is the
same sort of sand barrier island that existed in 1863. Visitors can
still experience a sense of what it would have felt like to fight on
the island, even if the land itself does not retain integrity.
Dredging operations in Charleston Harbor and the shipping
channels have also altered the landscape drastically. In several
locations, these efforts have created entirely new islands or
peninsulas. The dredging operations have destroyed many of the
sand bars that were present at the time of battle.
Aggressive development in Charleston, Mount Pleasant, James
Island, Folly Island, and Sullivan’s Island has damaged the historic
integrity of shoreline sites including the Confederate fortifications
of Fort Beauregard and the Marshall Battery. Much of the
landscape surrounding Fort Johnson has been destroyed by the
construction of a research facility. As more housing and
associated infrastructure development takes place at the water’s
edge, threats to the historic integrity of the landscape and harbor
viewshed will increase. The Confederate earthworks on James
Island are privately owned and, although their locations are
documented, there is no protection in place to preserve them.
Despite these challenges, Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie still stand
guard in Charleston Harbor, the Light House Inlet and Folly Island
landscapes have changed little, and many of the wetlands west of
Morris Island retain integrity.
While a large portion of the Study Area for Fort Wagner II,
retains integrity, much of that area is water. Any future
preservation will need to recognize the harbor’s role as a
contributing feature of the six battles of Charleston Harbor.
Battlefield advocates should consider focusing efforts on a larger
thematic approach to preservation for Charleston Harbor’s
battlefield landscapes.

of fortifications around Secessionville.
The expanded Core Area now includes the fields of fire associated with US
gunboats and armed transports near Stevens’ Landing, as well as the field
of fire from the Federal battery located north of Holland Island Creek.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Given the marshy, inaccessible character of the
surrounding landscape, routes used by US forces during their
advance inland from Grimball’s Landing and routes further south
at Sol Leagre Island remain intact. The waterways – DeSoto River
and Folly Island Creek – which were crucial to the operation, still
flow along courses very similar to their 1863 paths.
Significant residential development from the east and north
represents an advancing threat to Grimball’s Landing. This
development has already destroyed most of the Confederate
approach routes to the battlefield, along with the Confederate
batteries located near the marshes of James Island. On Sol Leagre
Island, much of the battlefield near the eastern causeway has
been destroyed. Development sprawling south from Charleston
represents the greatest threat to the remaining Confederate
batteries.
Grimball’s Landing has no associated listings in the National
Register of Historic Places. Preservation advocates should focus on
efforts to list what remains of Grimball’s Landing as a battlefield
landscape.

Study Area

3,926.96 acres
The ABPP revised the 1993 Study Area to include several misdirected
routes used by US forces while attempting to locate and destroy the
Charleston & Savannah Railroad near Grahamville. The ABPP included
these routes as part of the Study Area because this activity exhausted
Federal troops and delayed their arrival at Honey Hill, providing
Confederate forces extra time to prepare for battle. The Confederate
approach route from the railroad to the engagement area was also
included in the Study Area.
The ABPP expanded the Core Area’s southern boundary to include the
Euhaw Creek causeway where Confederate forces bombarded Federal
forces attempting to cross the creek. Along the northern edge, the ABPP
reduced the Core Area to better represent the range of Federal artillery
positioned along Wood Road.

Condition Statement

Portions of the landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. The Old House Plantation has suffered some
residential development, but the plantation retains its historic
view of Honey Hill Pond. Some of the open fields present during
the 1864 fighting retain their agricultural character, though most
of the land is tree-covered today. Boyd’s Landing retains much of
its historic integrity. Only a few hunting lodges interrupt an
otherwise unchanged landscape. The Boyd’s Landing roadbed
remains intact and, although part of the Old Grahamville Road has
been modernized, the surrounding landscape at Good Hope
Plantation is in good condition.
Unfortunately, the area around Honey Hill is under intense
development pressure. Rampant development has destroyed the
historic integrity of the battlefield landscape associated with the
towns of Ridgeland and Grahamville.
Some development along the Good Hope Plantation’s western
edge has already begun and, with more development planned,
preservation efforts should concentrate on protecting the
Confederate position at Honey Hill.

The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area to include the location of
Federal maneuvers against Rivers’ Bridge, Buford's Bridge, and Broxton's
Bridge. These maneuvers, coupled with the flanking of the Confederate
position at Rivers' Bridge, made the defense of the Salkehatchie River
untenable. The ABPP reduced the Core Area to only those areas that
came under Confederate fire, and locations where Federal forces
engaged in diversionary and flank attacks.

Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance. The
Salkehatchie River, with its accompanying wetlands, flows along a
course similar to its 1865 path. Earthworks used by the
Confederate defenders are preserved at Rivers Bridge State
Historic Site. The landscape clearly conveys an understanding of
why and how Confederate forces attempted to slow Sherman’s
drive through South Carolina at this location. River crossings to
the northwest and southeast of the state park, while modern, are
very near or on top of the original crossings and provide a good
sense of the battlefield’s breadth. Finally, some of the modern
roads in the region are positioned in historic beds, and traces of
some other roads used at the time of the battle are still evident.
Unfortunately, a portion of the bluff overlooking the river (upon
which several Confederate earthworks were located) was
significantly altered by the operations of a logging railroad that
paralleled the Salkehatchie River during the late 19th Century.24
State Park Highway, built in the 1950s almost entirely within the
boundaries of the Rivers Bridge Historic Site, changed the
traditional traffic flow through the site, and its construction
destroyed rifle pits on the left of the Confederate line. Beyond
the state park boundaries, the battlefield is framed by large
modern roads including State Route 641(Confederate Highway),
US Highway 601, (Broxton Bridge Highway), State Route 64 (Low
Country Highway), US Highway 301 (Buford's Bridge Highway),
and US Highway 321.
While battlefield land protected within the boundaries of the
Rivers Bridge State Historic Site is in good condition, funding for
the site is limited. Without sufficient resources for administrations
and operations, the preservation and interpretation at this site
could be in jeopardy.
River’s Bridge has the highest percentage of battlefield land
retaining integrity in the state and should be considered one of
South Carolina’s greatest opportunities for comprehensive
battlefield preservation.

Alteration of the bluff at Rivers’ Bridge was significant but not complete – approximately one quarter of the slope in front of the
Confederate earthworks was affected. It is currently unknown if the terrain in front of the earthworks at Broxton’s Bridge and
Buford’s Bridge were affected by the railroad’s activities.

was reduced to highlight the roads used by US troops moving through
the otherwise impassible, swampy terrain of James Island. Also
included is the approach route of US naval forces travelling up Folly
River Creek. The expanded Core Area includes the US naval
bombardment from Folly River Creek and the Confederate
counterattack north of Fort Lamar.

Condition Statement

The landscape and terrain have been altered beyond recognition.
The only remaining intact battlefield feature is Fort Lamar, which is
preserved by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.
Among several threats to the Fort Lamar site is Fort Lamar Road
which bisects the site, dividing it in half. Unfortunately ready
access to the site has led to residential development which now
surrounds the fort. Continued development will isolate the fort
from the its wider historic viewshed. Foot and bike trails cross over
the fort’s earthworks, and erosion resulting from this traffic poses
a very specific and serious threat. Finally, to the south, wetlands
that have grown larger since the time of battle could threaten to
erode battlefield land surrounding the fort. Despite this damage
to its context, the Fort Lamar structure is well preserved. If left
unchecked, however, these threats could destroy the only remaing
portion of the battlefield that retains integrity. Preservation
efforts should focus on protecting the integrity of the Fort Lamar
site.
Few other opportunities for cultural resource preservation exist
beyond what has been preserved and maintained at the Fort
Lamar site. Commemoration and public interpretation of the
larger battlefield, however, are possible and appropriate.
