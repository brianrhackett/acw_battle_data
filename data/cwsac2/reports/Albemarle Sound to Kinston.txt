Condition Statement

Given that the entire engagement took place on the waters of the
sound, the battlefield proper is little changed since the Civil War.
The battlefield’s larger setting is diminished by development on
the sound’s northern shoreline and by a railroad bridge and the

Condition Statement

Although the agricultural setting of the Averasborough battlefield
has changed little since the Civil War, modern development is
beginning to take its toll on this pastoral landscape. Family farms
are being subdivided into residential estates. The battlefield’s
proximity to Interstate 95 and the growing towns of Dunn and
Erwin make it a good candidate for future development. Federal,
state, and local entities should continue to strive for
comprehensive landscape protection at Averasborough before
additional subdivisions indelibly alter the battlefield.

Condition Statement

The land use at Bentonville has changed little since the Civil War.
The battlefield remains rural, its landscape remarkably intact.
However, scattered development continues within the battlefield,
especially along its intricate road network. Fortunately, the slow
pace of development has allowed the State time to protect more
than 1,200 acres of the battlefield since 1993. If the patterns of
slow, low-impact land development and State protection efforts
continue, much more of this nationally significant battlefield can
be saved within the decade.

The Study Area was revised substantially to reflect the multiple routes
used by Federal forces to approach and relieve the besieged fort, and
lands and waters over which US infantry and naval forces pursued the
withdrawing Confederates. The ABPP assigned a new Core Area at
Deep Gully, scene of Hill’s initial successful attack, and revised the
Core Area around Fort Anderson to reflect the area that came under
Confederate artillery bombardment.

Condition Statement

The landscape of Fort Fisher I has suffered from both natural and
manmade forces. Characteristic of the Outer Banks, the coastline
and the island’s dunes have shifted since the time of the battle.
Development of coastal towns north of Fort Fisher has destroyed
much of the desolate dune landscape of the Civil War period.
Most of what survives is already protected by state agencies and
the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. Small but significant
parcels may still be identified and protected at Fort Fisher I among
the coastal towns and military installations north of the state
historic site.

Most essential features of the Fort Macon battlefield survive. More
than 75 percent of the battlefield is either part of the Fort Macon
State Park or within the waters of the Rachel Carson Estuarine
Sanctuary in Beaufort Inlet. Today, preservation of the fort and

public education and sustainable resource management. The
remaining 25 percent of the historic battlefield has been lost to
residential and commercial development associated with the
growth of the town of Atlantic Beach.

Condition Statement

In December 1862, the Union army and navy approached Kinston
from different directions, resulting in a battlefield composed of
isolated engagement areas some distance from one another. That
historic fragmentation has been made worse by steady
development around the City of Kinston. This development has
been mitigated to some extent by the landscape restoration efforts
undertaken after the Federal Emergency Management Agency
purchased battlefield parcels in Rivermont and Meadowbrook and
the donated them to the county government. Future preservation
efforts should focus on the three viable Core Areas that represent
the engagements of December 13, 1862 south and east of the city.
