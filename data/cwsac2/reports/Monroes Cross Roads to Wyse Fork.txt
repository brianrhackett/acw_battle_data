Condition Statement

Most of the battlefield lies within the Fort Bragg Military
Reservation and has been spared residential and commercial
development. Through 1995, the Core Area was used for military
training purposes and some portions of this area were disturbed
through past land management and training activities. Today, 219
acres of the Core Area are protected and managed by the Fort
Bragg Cultural Resources Management Program as a National
Register-eligible archeological site. Other portions of the
battlefield Study Area remain within the danger zones of two
ordnance impact areas.

western Core Area represents the Union naval bombardment of a
Confederate sand battery west of town. The small southern Core
Area reflects an engagement associated with a limited Union sortie
against the Confederate line.

Accelerating growth from Manteo has overwhelmed the
battlefield. Only the western edge of the island and Croatan
Sound retain integrity. Completed in 2002, The Virginia Dare
Memorial Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 64/246 across the sound,
has diminished the setting and feeling of the water portion of the
battlefield (bridge not shown on USGS topographic map below).
Of the historic land remaining, most is protected by the National
Park Service and the State of North Carolina. The few
undeveloped but private parcels that contribute to the battlefield’s
integrity should be the focus of immediate protection efforts.

Condition Statement

Because the ten-day operation against Wilmington covered almost
29,000 acres of land on both sides of the Cape Fear River, it is not
surprising that the battlefield today is substantially altered in some
places but in relatively good condition in others. Preservation
initiatives need to target interconnected parcels within the
numerous Core Areas to protect and interpret as much of the
battle story as possible. Fortunately, portions of the battlefield are
owned by a variety of public entities, including the U.S.
Department of Defense’s Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, two
state historic sites, and Brunswick County. Cultural resource
management of battlefield landscapes and features on these
public lands can serve as anchor points for future battlefield
preservation, interpretation, and tourism.

The battlefield is little changed since the Civil War. Threats to the
rural landscape are increasing, however. Development pressure
from Kinston along U.S. Route 70, and the proposed U.S. Route 70
Kinston Bypass across the battlefield, imperil the site today.
Immediate protection of Wyse Fork as a “complete” battlefield
