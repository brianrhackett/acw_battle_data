Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance.
Cross Keys presents excellent opportunities for comprehensive
landscape preservation, but faces significant threats from highway
projects. Both the planned widening of Interstate 81 and the
proposed Harrisonburg bypass, if not designed by preservation
advocates and transportation planners to avoid or minimize
impacts, will destroy portions of the battlefield landscape and
irrevocably alter the character of this rural area.

Condition Statement

Land use is little changed since the period of significance.
However, Rt. 45 does bisect the historic landscape, leaving the
Core Area fragmented, and rapid development east of Rt. 45 will
continue to gnaw away portions of the Core Area.
