have already affected the Core Area of the battlefield. As development
pressure increases, the need for active protection of the surviving
battlefield becomes critical.

Condition Statement

Portions of landscape have been altered, but most essential
features remain. Ongoing growth of residential housing and
transportation networks on the edges of the historical park and
along the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers will continue to degrade
the site. Residential and commercial development will also
compromise key viewsheds and the setting of the battlefield.
Coordinated preservation efforts over the next five years are
needed to save the roughly 4,000 acres of unprotected, surviving
battlefield land.

Condition Statement

Much of the landscape has been altered and fragmented, leaving
some essential features. The battlefield has suffered rapid
development along US 11 from Hainesville to Falling Waters and
west of US 11 along Route 901. Interstate 81 bisects the
battlefield as well.

Continued development likely will eradicate the remaining
vestiges of this battlefield within 10 years. The entire battlefield is
located within Berkeley County's Growth Management boundary
and is designated as a growth area.
Immediate protection efforts are needed to save the undeveloped
Core Area land west of US 11, Stumpy Hollow, the high ground
around Hainesville, and the site of the Confederate camp.

manufactured housing at the crossroads. Development associated
with the Gauley River National Recreation Area is also nearing the
battlefield. Although a small portion of the southern Study Area is
in state and federal ownership, no known efforts have been made
to protect this battlefield specifically. Kessler’s Cross Lanes
presents one of the best opportunities in West Virginia for
comprehensive battlefield preservation. This goal will require
concerted efforts by local, state, and federal entities.
