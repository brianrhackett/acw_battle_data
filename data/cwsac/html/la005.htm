<p><b>Date(s):</b> October 27, 1862

<P><b>Description:</b>  Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, commanding Union forces in

the Department of the Gulf, launched an expedition into the Bayou Lafourche

region to eliminate the Rebel threat from that area, to make sure that

sugar and cotton products from there would come into Union hands and, in

the future, to use it as a base for other military operations. He organized

a brigade of about 4,000 men under the command of his protege Brig. Gen.

Godfrey Weitzel to accomplish the missions. On October 25, Weitzel and

his men arrived at Donaldsonville, where the Lafourche meets the Mississippi,

and began an advance up the east bank of the bayou. The Confederates under

the command of Brig. Gen. Alfred Mouton attempted to concentrate to meet

the threat. By the 27th, the Confederates had occupied a position on the

bayou above Labadieville. A little more than half the force was on the

east bank while the rest of the men were on the west bank near Georgia

Landing, generally without means of concentrating on one side or the other.

As the Federal troops continued down the east bank, they encountered the

Rebels at about 11:00 am and began skirmishing. The Confederates fell back

quickly. Weitzel then began crossing his men to the west bank to attack

the Rebel troops there. For some time, these Confederate troops fought

resolutely and brought the Union assault to a standstill. The Rebels, however,

ran out of artillery ammunition and had to withdraw to Labadieville, opening

up this portion of the Lafourche to the Union.
