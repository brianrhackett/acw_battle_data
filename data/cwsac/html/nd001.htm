<p><b>Campaign:</b> Operations against the Sioux in North Dakota (1863)

<p><b>Date(s):</b> July 24-25, 1863

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Brig. Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley [US]; Chief Inkpaduta

[I]
<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> District of Minnesota [US]; Santee and Teton Sioux [I]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> Total unknown (US unknown; I 13)


<P><b>Description:</b>  Brig. Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley led his troops from Fort

Ridgely, Minnesota, into the Dakotas, pursuing the Santee Sioux, who had

initiated an uprising in the Minnesota River Valley in August 1862. The

Santee had joined forces with the Teton Sioux. Having marched all day on

July 24, 1863, Sibley’s scouts, around 1:00 pm, reported that they had

spotted a large Native American camp a few miles away. Sibley established

a camp on a nearby salt lake and set his men to entrenching it for protection.&nbsp;

While in the process of making camp, numerous Native Americans appeared

expressing friendship. A number of them approached the scouts gathered

about 300-400 yards from the camp and began talking with them. Surgeon

Josiah S. Weiser, 1st Regiment Minnesota Mounted Rangers, joined the assembly,

but soon afterwards a Sioux shot and killed him. The scouts attempted to

kill the attacker but he escaped. Native Americans who had hidden behind

the surrounding ridges now emerged and attacked. In detachments, the soldiers

went out to meet the Native Americans. Sibley, with some men, approached

the “Big Mound” on the opposite side of the ravine. He attempted to dislodge

those Sioux who were on the upper part of the large ravine firing at the

infantry and cavalry with impunity. The Union forces displaced these and

other well-placed Sioux in the surrounding ridges by accurate artillery

fire and forced them into the broken prairie where they fled in confusion.

The mounted troops, with some of the infantry and artillery following,

set out in pursuit. A running battle ensued for the rest of the day.&nbsp;

Before dark, the soldiers broke off the pursuit and returned to camp as

previously ordered, some not arriving until the next morning. The Sioux

forces were broken and dispirited.
