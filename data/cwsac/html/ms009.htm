<P><b>Other Names:</b> Bakers Creek

<p><b>Location:</b> Hinds County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Grant’s Operations against Vicksburg (1863)


<p><b>Date(s):</b> May 16, 1863

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant [US]; Lt. Gen. John

C. Pemberton [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Army of the Tennessee (three corps) [US]; Department

of Mississippi and East Louisiana [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 6,757 total (US 2,457; CS 4,300)

<P><b>Description:</b> Following the Union occupation of Jackson, Mississippi,

both Confederate and Federal forces made plans for future operations. Gen.

Joseph E. Johnston retreated, with most of his army, up the Canton Road,

but he ordered Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton, commanding about 23,000 men,

to leave Edwards Station and attack the Federals at Clinton. Pemberton

and his generals felt that Johnston’s plan was dangerous and decided instead

to attack the Union supply trains moving from Grand Gulf to Raymond. On

May 16, though, Pemberton received another order from Johnston repeating

his former directions. Pemberton had already started after the supply trains

and was on the Raymond-Edwards Road with his rear at the crossroads one-third

mile south of the crest of Champion Hill. Thus, when he ordered a countermarch,

his rear, including his many supply wagons, became the advance of his force.

On May 16, 1863, about 7:00 am, the Union forces engaged the Confederates

and the Battle of Champion Hill began. Pemberton’s force drew up into a

defensive line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton

was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against

his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen.

Stephen D. Lee's men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the

reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops

and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the

Rebels off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the

Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion

House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant

arrived at Champion Hill, around 10:00 am, he ordered the attack to begin.

By 11:30 am, Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and about

1:00 pm, they took the crest while the Rebels retired in disorder. The

Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson

Road escape route. One of Pemberton's divisions (Bowen’s) then counterattacked,

pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge

came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had

just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. Pemberton’s men could not stand

up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape

route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen.

Lloyd Tilghman’s brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs,

including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized

the Bakers Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates

were in full retreat towards Vicksburg. If the Union forces caught these

Rebels, they would destroy them.
