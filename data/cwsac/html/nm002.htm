<P><b>Description:</b> Glorieta Pass was a strategic location, situated at the

southern tip of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, southeast of Santa Fe,

and on the Santa Fe Trail. In March 1862, a Confederate force of 200-300

Texans under the command of Maj. Charles L. Pyron encamped at Johnson’s

Ranch, at one end of the pass. Union Maj. John M. Chivington led more than

400 soldiers to the Pass and on the morning of March 26 moved out to attack.

After noon, Chivington’s men captured some Rebel advance troops and then

found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their

artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two

sides of the pass, caught the Rebels in a crossfire, and soon forced them

to retire. Pyron and his men retired about a mile and a half to a narrow

section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington’s men

appeared. The Yankees flanked Pyron’s men again and punished them with

enfilade fire. The Confederates fled again and the Union cavalry charged,

capturing the rearguard. Chivington then retired and went into camp at

Kozlowski’s Ranch. No fighting occurred the next day as reinforcements

arrived for both sides. Lt. Col. William R. Scurry’s troops swelled the

Rebel ranks to about 1,100 while Union Col. John P. Slough arrived with

about 900 men. Both Slough and Scurry decided to attack and set out early

on the 28th to do so. As Scurry advanced down the canyon, he saw the Union

forces approaching, so he established a battle line, including his dismounted

cavalry. Slough hit them before 11:00 am. The Confederates held their ground

and then attacked and counterattacked throughout the afternoon. The fighting

then ended as Slough retired first to Pigeon’s Ranch and then to Kozlowski’s

Ranch. Scurry soon left the field also, thinking he had won the battle.

Chivington’s men, how-ever, had destroyed all Scurry’s supplies and animals

at Johnson’s Ranch, forcing him to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step

on the long road back to San Antonio, Texas. The Federals had won and,

thereby, stopped Confederate incursions into the Southwest. Glorieta Pass

was the turning point of the war in the New Mexico Territory.
