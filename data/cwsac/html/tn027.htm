<P><b>Description:</b>  Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis received a report on the night
of December 28, 1863, that a brigade of enemy cavalry was in the neighborhood
of Dandridge that afternoon. Surmising that the Rebel cavalry force was
split, Sturgis decided to meet and defeat, and possibly capture, this portion
of it. He ordered most of his troopers out toward Dandridge on two roads.
After these troops had left, Maj. Gen. William T. Martin, commander of
Longstreet’s Confederate cavalry, now reunited, attacked the remainder
of Sturgis’s force at Mossy Creek, Tennessee, which included the First
Brigade, Second Division, XXIII Army Corps, commanded by Col. Samuel R.
Mott, at 9:00 am. First, Sturgis sent messages to his subordinates on the
way to Dandridge to return promptly if they found no enemy there. The Confederates
advanced, driving the Federals in front of them. Some of the Union troopers
who had set out for Dandridge returned. Around 3:00 pm, fortunes changed
as the Federals began driving the Confederates. By dark, the Rebels were
back to the location from which they had begun the battle.&nbsp; Union
pursuit was not mounted that night, but Martin retreated from the area.
After the victory at Mossy Creek, the Union held the line about Talbott’s
Station for some time.
