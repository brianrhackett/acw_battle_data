<P><b>Location:</b> Unknown
<P><b>Campaign:</b> Operations in the Indian Territory (1861)

<P><b>Date(s):</b> November 19, 1861

<P><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Chief Opothleyahola [I]; Col. Douglas H. Cooper

[CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Creek and Seminole [I]; Indian Department [CS]


<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> Unknown

<P><b>Description:</b> Col. Douglas H. Cooper, Confederate commander of the Indian

Department, had not been able to reconcile differences with Chief Opothleyahola,

who commanded a band of Unionist Creeks and Seminoles. Cooper set out on

November 15, 1861, with about 1,400 men to&nbsp; either compel submission

. . . or “drive him and his party from the country.”&nbsp; His force rode

up the Deep Fork of the Canadian River towards Chief Opothleyahola’s camp

which they found deserted. On the 19th, Cooper learned from captured prisoners

that part of Chief Opothleyahola’s band was at the Red Fork of the Arkansas

River, where they were erecting a fort. Cooper’s men arrived there around

4:00 pm and ordered a cavalry charge which discovered that Chief Opothleyahola’s

band had recently abandoned the camp. The Confederates did find some stragglers

beyond the camp and followed them, blundering into Chief Opothleyahola’s

camp. The Federals fired into the Rebel cavalry and, in large force, came

out to attack them. They chased the Confederates back to Cooper’s main

force. Darkness prevented Cooper from attacking until the main enemy force

was within 60 yards. A short fight ensued but Chief Opothleyahola’s men

broke it off and retreated back to their camp. Cooper set out for Chief

Opothleyahola’s camp the next morning but found it gone. The Confederates

claimed victory because Chief Opothleyahola had left the area. This was

the first of three encounters between Chief Opothleyahola’s Union bands

and Confederate troops. The chief was forced to flee Oklahoma for Kansas

at the end of the year.
