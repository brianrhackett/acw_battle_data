<p><b>Location:</b> Dickey County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Operations against the Sioux in North Dakota (1863)

<p><b>Date(s):</b> September 3-5, 1863

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully [US]; Chief Inkpaduta

[I]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Northwestern Expedition (600-700) [US]; Santee, Yankton,

Cut-heads, Hunkapapa and Teton Sioux and Blackfeet (1,200-1,500) [I]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 822 total (US 72; I 750)

<P><b>Description:</b>  Following Brig. Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley’s victories

over the Sioux, he left the area, crossing the James River. The Sioux then

recrossed the Missouri River and returned to their old hunting grounds.

Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully decided to find these Sioux and punish them, if

possible. By September 3, Sully reached a lake where he found numerous

remains of recently killed buffalo. A 6th Iowa Cavalry detachment discovered

a Native American camp of more than 400 lodges, about 3:00 pm, which they

endeavored to surround until a courier could inform Sully. Word reached

Sully around 4:00 pm, and he set out with the rest of the troops, except

for the poorly mounted men who remained to protect the animals and supplies.

About an hour later, Sully and his men arrived at the Sioux camp and observed

that the Sioux were attempting to leave. Sully sent in his troops to help

the 6th Iowa Cavalry. Although the Sioux did counterattack, it was to no

avail. The Sioux eventually broke under the firepower and fled, hotly pursued.

Fighting subsided after dark but scattered firing continued. Sully ordered

the bugler to sound rally, and all the troops remained at arms during the

rest of the night. In the morning, Sully established a camp on the battlefield

and, during the next two days, sent out scouting parties looking for remnants

of the enemy. He also ordered the destruction of Native American foodstuffs,

supplies, etc., found in the area. On September 5, one officer and 27 men

from the 2nd Nebraska and 6th Iowa Cavalry regiments went in search of

a surgeon and eight men missing since the battle on the 3rd. About 15 miles

northwest of camp, they were attacked by a party of about 300 Sioux. The

men could not stand up to this number of the enemy and began a slow retreat

while returning fire.&nbsp; As the enemy came closer, the men panicked

and stepped up their retirement despite entreaties from the officers. They

eventually returned to camp and safety, after losing six men in the skirmish.

Altogether, Sully’s men overran a large Sioux camp, destroyed much of the

contents, killed or wounded a large number of men, and captured numerous

women and children. This engagement weakened but did not destroy the Native

American resistance in the area.
