<P><b>Description:</b> In late Spring 1862, the Confederacy split its forces in
Tennessee into several small commands in an attempt to complicate Federal
operations. The Union had to redistribute its forces to counter the Confederate
command structure changes. Maj. Gen. Ormsby Mitchel received orders to
go to Huntsville, Alabama, with his division to repair railroads in the
area. Soon, he occupied more than 100 miles along the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga
and Memphis &amp; Charleston railroads.&nbsp; In May, Mitchel and his men
sparred with Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith’s men. After Mitchel received
command of all Federal troops between Nashville and Huntsville, on May
29, he ordered Brig. Gen. James Negley with a small division to lead an
expedition to capture Chattanooga. This force arrived before Chattanooga
on June 7. Negley ordered the 79th Pennsylvania Volunteers out to reconnoiter.
It found the Confederates entrenched on the opposite side of the river
along the banks and atop Cameron Hill. Negley brought up two artillery
batteries to open fire on the Rebel troops and the town and sent infantry
to the river bank to act as sharpshooters. The Union bombardment of Chattanooga
continued throughout the 7th and until noon on the 8th. The Confederates
replied, but it was uncoordinated since the undisciplined gunners were
allowed to do as they wished. On June 10, Smith, who had arrived on the
8th, reported that Negley had withdrawn and the Confederate loss was minor.&nbsp;
This attack on Chattanooga was a warning that Union troops could mount
assaults when they wanted.
<P><b>Result(s):</b> Union victory
