<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 265 total (US 100; CS 165)
<P><b>Description:</b> Since the Battle of Dandridge, the Union cavalry had moved
to the south side of the French Broad River and had disrupted Confederate
foraging and captured numerous wagons in that area. On January 25, 1864,
Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, commander of the Department of East Tennessee,
instructed his subordinates to do something to curtail Union operations
south of the French Broad. On the 26th, Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis, having
had various brushes with Confederate cavalry, deployed his troopers to
watch the area fords. Two Confederate cavalry brigades and artillery advanced
from Fair Garden in the afternoon but were checked about four miles from
Sevierville. Other Confederates attacked a Union cavalry brigade, though,
at Fowler’s on Flat Creek, and drove it about two miles. No further fighting
occurred that day. Union scouts observed that the Confederates had concentrated
on the Fair Garden Road, so Sturgis ordered an attack there in the morning.
In a heavy fog, Col. Edward M. McCook’s Union division attacked and drove
back Maj. Gen. William T. Martin’s Confederates until about 4:00 pm. At
that time, McCook’s men charged with sabers and routed the Rebels. Sturgis
set out in pursuit on the 28th, and captured and killed more of the routed
Rebels. The Union forces, however, observed three of Longstreet’s infantry
brigades crossing the river. Realizing his weariness from fighting, lack
of supplies, ammunition, and weapons and the overwhelming strength of the
enemy, Sturgis decided to evacuate the area. But, before leaving, Sturgis
determined to attack Brig. Gen. Frank C. Armstrong’s Confederate cavalry
division which he had learned was about three or four miles away, on the
river.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to the attacking Federals, Armstrong had strongly
fortified his position and three infantry regiments had arrived to reinforce
him. Thus, the Union troops suffered severe casualties in the attack. The
battle continued until dark, when the Federals retired from the area. The
Federals had won the big battle but the fatigue of continual fighting and
lack of supplies and ammunition forced them to withdraw.
