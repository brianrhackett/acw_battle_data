<P><b>Other Names:</b> Baxter Springs Massacre

<P><b>Location:</b> Cherokee County

<P><b>Campaign:</b> Occupation of Indian Territory North of the Arkansas River

(1863)

<P><b>Date(s):</b> October 6, 1863

<P><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Lt. James B. Pond and Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt

[US]; Lt. Col. William C. Quantrill [CS]


<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Detachments from three regiments and an escort [US];

Quantrill’s Raiders (approx. 400) [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 106 total (US 103; CS 3)


<P><b>Description:</b> After conducting many raids in Kansas, including the massacre

at Lawrence, Quantrill decided to winter in Texas. Along with other partisans,

he headed south on the Texas Road and captured and killed two Union teamsters

who had come from a post called Baxter Springs. Quantrill decided to attack

the post and divided his force into two columns, one under him and the

other commanded by a subordinate, David Poole. Poole and his men proceeded

down the Texas Road, where they encountered Union soldiers, most of whom

were African Americans. They chased and attacked the Union troops, killing

some of them before they reached the earth and log fort. After the Union

survivors reached the fort, the Rebels attacked, but the garrison, with

the help of a howitzer, fought them off. Quantrill’s column moved on the

post from another direction and chanced on a Union detachment escorting

Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt and wagons transporting his personal items from

his former headquarters of the Department of the Frontier at Fort Scott

to his new one at Fort Smith. Most of this detachment, including the band

and Maj. Henry Z. Curtis (son of Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis), was murdered,

but Blunt and a few mounted men returned to Fort Scott. Blunt was removed

from command for failing to protect his column, but he was soon restored.

Touted as a massacre by some, Baxter Springs was another of the events

that characterized the vicious Kansas-Missouri border warfare.
