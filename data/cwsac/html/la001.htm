<p><b>Location:</b> Plaquemines Parish

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Expedition to and Capture of New Orleans (1862)

<p><b>Date(s):</b> April 16-28, 1862


<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Flag-Officer David G. Farragut [US]; Brig. Gen.

Johnson K. Duncan and Cdr. John K. Mitchell [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> West Gulf Blockading Squadron [US]; Garrisons of Forts

Jackson and St. Philip and the crews of various ships [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 1,011 total (US 229; CS 782)

<P><b>Description:</b> Early Union plans had called for the division of the Confederacy

by seizing control of the Mississippi River. One of the first steps in

such operations was to enter the mouth of the Mississippi River, ascend

to New Orleans and capture the city, closing off the entrance to Rebel

ships. In mid-January 1862, Flag-Officer David G. Farragut undertook this

enterprise with his West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The way was soon open

except for the two forts, Jackson and St. Philip, above the Head of the

Passes, approximately seventy miles below New Orleans. In addition to the

forts and their armament, the Confederates had placed obstructions in the

river and there were a number of ships, including two ironclads, to assist

in the defense. Farragut based his operations from Ship Island, Mississippi,

and on April 8, he assembled 24 of his vessels and Comdr. David D. Porter's

19 mortar schooners near the Head of the Passes. Starting on the 16th and

continuing for seven days, the mortar schooners bombarded Fort Jackson

but failed to silence its guns. Some of Farragut’s gunboats opened a way

through the obstruction on the night of the 22nd. Early on the morning

of the 24th, Farragut sent his ships north to pass the forts and head for

New Orleans. Although the Rebels attempted to stop the Union ships in various

ways, most of the force successfully passed the forts and continued on

to New Orleans where Farragut accepted the city’s surrender. With the passage

of the forts, nothing could stop the Union forces: the fall of New Orleans

was inevitable and anti-climatic. Cut off and surrounded, the garrisons

of the two forts surrendered on the 28th.
