<p><b>Campaign:</b> Sully’s Expedition against the Sioux in Dakota Territory (1864)
<p><b>Date(s):</b> July 28-29, 1864

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully [US]; Chief Inkpaduta

[I]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Detachments from eight units (2,200) [US];&nbsp; Santee

and Teton Sioux [I]



<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> Unknown

<P><b>Description:</b> Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully, who had defeated the recalcitrant

Sioux at Whitestone Hill in September 1863, wintered on the Missouri River.

During the winter, Sully’s superior, Maj. Gen. John Pope, formulated a

plan for ending the difficulties with the Sioux.&nbsp; He would order a

force of about 2,500 men, commanded by Sully, into the field to find the

Native Americans and engage them in battle. In addition, he would send

infantry behind Sully’s force to establish strong-posts in the “Indian

country.”&nbsp; Thus, Minnesota troops were ordered to meet Sully’s force

at the mouth of Burdache Creek on the Upper Missouri for active campaigning.&nbsp;

The two columns rendezvoused on June 30 and set out against the Sioux.

They established Fort Rice on July 7 at the mouth of Cannonball River and

moved on. The Sioux, who had been operating north of Fort Rice, moved across

the Missouri River and took a strong position on the Little Missouri River,

about 200 miles from the fort. On July 26, Sully marched out to engage

them in battle.&nbsp; On the 28th, he arrived near the Native American

camp which he reported included 5,000-6,000 warriors “strongly posted in

wooded country, very much cut up with high, rugged hills, and deep, impassible

ravines.” Sully met with some of the tribal chiefs first, but nothing came

of it so he attacked. Heavy fighting ensued, but eventually the artillery

and long-range firearms took effect and the Sioux began losing ground.

The retirement turned into flight. The Native Americans left all their

possessions, and a running fight of almost nine miles scattered the warriors

who were not wounded or killed. Killdeer Mountain broke the back of the

Sioux resistance.&nbsp; Sully did meet the remnants of the Sioux warriors

that had escaped Killdeer Mountain in August and defeated them, but they

had none of the spirit formally exhibited.
