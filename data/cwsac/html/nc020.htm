<P><b>Other Names:</b> Bentonsville

<p><b>Location:</b> Johnston County

<p><b>Campaign:</b> Campaign of the Carolinas (February-April 1865)

<p><b>Date(s):</b> March 19-21, 1865


<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman and Maj. Gen. Henry

Slocum [US]; Gen. Joseph E. Johnston [CS]


<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b> Sherman’s Right Wing (XX and XIV Corps) [US]; Johnston's

Army [CS]

<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> 4,738 total (US 1,646; CS 3,092)

<P><b>Description:</b> While Slocum’s advance was stalled at Averasborough by

Hardee’s troops, the right wing of Sherman’s army under command of Maj.

Gen. O.O. Howard marched toward Goldsborough.&nbsp; On March 19, Slocum

encountered the entrenched Confederates of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston who

had concentrated to meet his advance at Bentonville. Late afternoon, Johnston

attacked, crushing the line of the XIV Corps. Only strong counterattacks

and desperate fighting south of the Goldsborough Road blunted the Confederate

offensive. Elements of the XX Corps were thrown into the action as they

arrived on the field. Five Confederate attacks failed to dislodge the Federal

defenders and darkness ended the first day’s fighting. During the night,

Johnston contracted his line into a “V” to protect his flanks with Mill

Creek to his rear. On March 20, Slocum was heavily reinforced, but fighting

was sporadic. Sherman was inclined to let Johnston retreat. On the 21st,

however, Johnston remained in position while he removed his wounded. Skirmishing

heated up along the entire front. In the afternoon, Maj. Gen. Joseph Mower

led his Union division along a narrow trace that carried it across Mill

Creek into Johnston’s rear. Confederate counterattacks stopped Mower’s

advance, saving the army’s only line of communication and retreat. Mower

withdrew, ending fighting for the day. During the night, Johnston retreated

across the bridge at Bentonville. Union forces pursued at first light,

driving back Wheeler’s rearguard and saving the bridge. Federal pursuit

was halted at Hannah’s Creek after a severe skirmish. Sherman, after regrouping

at Goldsborough, pursued Johnston toward Raleigh. On April 18, Johnston

signed an armistice with Sherman at the Bennett House, and on April 26,

formally surrendered his army.
