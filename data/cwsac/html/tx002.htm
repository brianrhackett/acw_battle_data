<P><b>Other Names:</b> None

<p><b>Location:</b> Galveston County
<p><b>Campaign:</b> Operations to Blockade the Texas Coast (1862-63)

<p><b>Date(s):</b> October 4, 1862

<p><b>Principal Commanders:</b> Cdr. W.B. Renshaw, U.S.N. [US]; Col. Joseph J.

Cook and Col. X.B. Debray [CS]

<P><b>Forces Engaged:</b>  None


<P><b>Estimated Casualties:</b> None
<P><b>Description:</b> The U.S. Navy began a blockade of Galveston Harbor in July

1861, but the town remained in Confederate hands for the next 14 months.

At 6:00 am on October 4, 1862, Cdr. W.B. Renshaw, commanding the blockading

ships in the Galveston Bay area, sent Harriet Lane into the harbor, flying

a flag of truce. The intention was to inform the military authorities in

Galveston that if the town did not surrender, the U.S. Navy ships would

attack; a one-hour reply would be demanded. Col. Joseph J. Cook, Confederate

military commander in the area, would not come out to the Union ship or

send an officer to receive the communication, so Harriet Lane weighed anchor

and returned to the fleet. Four Union steamers, with a mortar boat in tow,

entered the harbor and moved to the same area where Harriet Lane had anchored.&nbsp;

Observing this activity, Confederates at Fort Point fired one or more shots

and the U.S. Navy ships answered. Eventually, the Union ships disabled

the one Confederate gun at Fort Point and fired at other targets. Two Rebel

guns from another location opened on the Union ships. The boat that Col.

Cook had dispatched now approached the Union vessels and two Confederate

officers boarded U.S.S. Westfield. Renshaw demanded an unconditional surrender

of Galveston or he would begin shelling. Cook refused Renshaw’s terms,

and conveyed to Renshaw that upon him rested the responsibility of destroying

the town and killing women, children, and aliens. Renshaw threatened to

resume the shelling and made preparations for towing the mortar boat into

position.&nbsp; One of the Confederate officers then asked if he could

be granted time to talk with Col. Cook again. This officer, a major, negotiated

with Renshaw for a four-day truce to evacuate the women, children, and

aliens from the city. Cook approved the truce but added a stipulation that

if Renshaw would not move troops closer to Galveston, Cook would not permit

his men to come below the city.&nbsp; The agreement was finalized but never

written down, which later caused problems. The Confederates did evacuate,

taking all of their weapons, ammunition, supplies, and whatever they could

carry with them. Renshaw did not think that the agreement allowed for all

this but, in the end, did nothing, due to the lack of a written document.

The fall of Galveston meant that one more important Confederate port was

closed to commerce. But the port of Galveston was not shut down for long.
