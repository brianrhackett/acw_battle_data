First, all documents are given a short title that consists of the principal author's last name and its date of publication. For example, Hartley-1989c refers to a work by Hartley published in 1989. The added later, c, indicates that the document referred to is the third publication in 1989 by this author. These short titles serve as the key document identifiers. Second, Appendix A gives a list if the full document titles in order by these short titles. Third, Appendix B gives a short subject index to the documents, classified by selected subject categories. Fourth, Appendix C gives a key word index to the full titles arranged alphabetically by the key words they contain. The annotated bibliography itself is in Appendix D, arranged in order by the short titles described above.},

scholarship. This paper outlines the process of an inquiry into this historical
imbroglio.

yet, improved by others, it is important that we document and publish the

This paper utilizes data from the original Treasury reports to investigate the implications of war-induced fiscal expansion for debt and note issues, and for the inflation rate. The former are found to be influenced primarily by the state of the Confederate budget, while the inflation rate appears to be driven by a "confidence" index tied to developments on the military front.},
